1004,2004.0,Q&A,a,"Good morning, Tom., Well, I think the margin trend is positive.  I mean, you're looking at margins going up to 15.9 for the quarter?  15.9 from 15.6.  Where were they?, The margin was 15.6, up from 11.9., Yes, 15.6.  So, the margins – the direction of the margins are going the right direction.  We believe those margins will continue to increase, particularly as we get more work through our facilities.  Although the components shop is doing better, they're still not back to where they have been historically.  So, we're running in many of these facilities, single shifts, as you know, Tom, we have the ability to run double shifts very easily, and even three shifts when times get very good.  So, when you look at the ability to consume, or to – yes, consume some of the overhead, we need more volumes, and, you know, that's where we're heading.  I think the sales increase, the 23% sales increase is healthy.  You know it's coming off a relatively low base last year – for your call last year this period, March/April/May were somewhat impacted by SARS.  We hate to keep mentioning, you know, those events from the past, but nevertheless as we get more volume through the place you'll see our margins start to increase., Part of what you're seeing also is in the new parts distribution as we segue into the more profitable segments.  There is still some stuff we're doing at lower margins, than we would like, and that business will continue to diminish as well.  So, we are expecting the margins to continue to improve particularly as we bring more volume through the facility.  Overall the trend is going that direction.  Right now we will have – we would have experienced better margins in the period just ended., We are not expecting that.  We do, as you know, we operate some businesses with unions.  We have successful businesses; we've been very profitable with businesses with unions.  And we've been profitable with units without unions.  So it's our intention to offer the employee base a very attractive work environment, and we believe that we – and we've had very good feedback from folks in Indianapolis looking to get back into the aircraft maintenance business.  And we believe we'll have wonderful relationships with those employees whether they be union or not., Yeah, we're excited.  We should be up and running.  Right now we're aggressively shooting for November 1.  It may not happen until December 1, but right now we're shooting for November 1., Yep., Good morning, Jim., Great, We will have some upfront costs.  The contract we negotiated provides for the Airport Authority to help fund some of those startup costs.  But we will have some startup costs over and above what's being financed by the Authority., There's a variable there.  There is a payback when we actually start doing – putting aircraft through the facility.  We have incentive that comes back to us with the first three aircraft that go through the facility.  So in essence we will be more than compensated for our startup expenses.  There is some timing issues, and I'm not at liberty at this point in time to speak directly to what that impact will be between now and November.  I will say this, that the deal, the plan right now plans for us to be accretive in the first 12 months of operation.  And accretive actually even in this fiscal year., We may have some – we may have some expenses that we will incur here., First two quarters., Yes., And it won't be dramatic., We when get to the full eight days you're looking at, you know, in excess of $100 million, and actually you get an excess of $100 million before that if we, in fact, get to that point., I'm sorry, I said eight.  I meant seven days.  We start with two bays, we then control another eight, so it's as many as ten bays.  And you know the revenues get very appealing once you get to say the fourth, fifth and sixth bay., Not at this point.  Not at this point.  It's something that we can explore at the right time, but at this point that would not be in our plan., Yep, thank you., We did that just to – we really looked at the accounts receivable securitization as a form of financing.  After we raised the convertible notes it was no longer necessary to have the drawn downs on the accounts receivable securitization program.  The program is available though for us to draw as a source of liquidity in the future., That is a non-recourse debt on a 767-300 aircraft., I believe what you're seeing is, you're seeing both.  The requirement of both to increase capacity, so you've seen aircraft come out of the desert not just for the commercial airlines – airliners, but also for the freight carriers.  You know I think we indicated in our opening comments that we're seeing available seat miles increase.  Some of that is coming from the factories, but a good portion of that is also coming from aircraft coming out of the desert.  So I think you're seeing it, not just – and you're seeing it not just in North America, but you're also seeing it elsewhere around the world.  And the numbers we've cited are international numbers.  So we're seeing demand for lift coming out of the Central America.  We're seeing demand for lift coming out of Asia, and we're seeing demand for lift coming out of Southern Europe.  We are – do believe that in North American you saw the shift, if you will, in terms of capacity, and some of that shift is going to the lower-cost operators at the expense, if you will, of the – let's call them the legacy carriers.  But I think even some of the legacy carriers have been pulling recently some aircraft out of the desert., Well first of all, obviously more aircraft come into the system.  More opportunities to the MRO industry, and as folks like United shedding their Indianapolis maintenance facility that creates opportunities for outsourcing that didn't exist previously.  And you may have seen that we recently signed some contracts with Alaska Airlines, for instance, where they were performing certain maintenance and size in-house that they have outsourced to us., So as the – as more aircraft come into the system that's a good thing for the MROs, and as more aircraft come into the system as the capacity gets chewed up, if you will, or eaten up then you know that's good for – helps strengthen pricing., Yeah, I would say the contracts are medium- to long-term.  And then you have, we do have some drop-in work that, you know, somebody may call us tomorrow, asking us if we have space available.  If we do, they may send an aircraft in five days., Thank you, Tom., Yes, thanks, Tom.  We're trying to figure out the answer to the first part of your question.  So I think from a P&L standpoint there was no impact.  There was money spent, but that money was covered through our agreement with the Indianapolis authorities.  As you recall, we indicated early on that the upfront investment would be minimal.  Obviously there's a lot of time and management effort put into this operation, so there has been a fair investment that would be hard to figure out what it is monetarily., There's no P&L impact on the investments that have been made, to date., Second part of your question?, Okay.  So we expect by the end of the – by the end of our third quarter, we expect to have anywhere from two to three bays running by the end of the quarter.  So we will – the first aircraft will be arriving next week, I believe, and that work will commence on that aircraft beginning – I think it's January 5 or 7.  I think it's either that Wednesday or that Friday of that week and then we will commence another line in latter January and then there will be a line towards the end of February.  That's, at least, the forecast at this point., I think flat to slightly down., Thank you, Tom., Good morning, Peter., I think we prefer not to comment.  I don't think we've commented before.  In both cases, you have meaningful programs, so you know the MoD program should be not fully kicked in but mostly kicked in by the fourth quarter and the Stewart & Stevenson program should experience good shipments during the fourth quarter period., That will be our expectation., I do, Peter.  In the inventory & logistics, gross profit margin was 12,569,000 for the quarter, 19%, MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) was 5,765,000, manufacturing was 9,279,000, and aircraft sales and leasing was 965., Very strong.  The challenge for us at this point in time is staffing and making sure we do a great job for the customers that come in so I spent last couple of days in Indianapolis visiting with the facility and the management team and gone through a kind of an analysis of where we stand today versus the demand and things we need to do between now and say the end of January to have the facility prepared to accept the work., In the first quarter, Peter, we had a discount on some notes that we had repurchased that flowed through the interest expense line, impacting about $0.5 million in the first quarter., Thanks Peter., Depreciation and amortization was 6.9 million.  CapEx in the quarter was 3.1 million.  Year-to-date we're 6.7 in CapEx and our forecast for the full fiscal year is approximately $14.5 million., Jay, the plan at this point in time would be that we would have, of those three, two would be nose-to-tail, and then the third nose-to-tail line would come up in, say, late March, early April.  So, we would anticipate that -- at this point in time, we're in dialogue with the customer on three nose-to-tail lines for the balance of the year.  And then we would have another line that would be more intermittent., That would be right.  I mean, from the time we open up the third line, it would be 100% booked., When I say 100% in that business, you know things happen.  So the plan, the commitment is for nose-to-tail for 3 lines.  Okay?, For those 3 lines that's correct.  And those that – we're going to keep a fourth line that would be taking work, like I said, intermittently., Yes, sequential improvement, year-over-year, slight improvement., Slight improvement, year-over-year., And sequentially we are up., Well, those engines have been obviously less important to us, really since 9/11.  So, we still see some activity in the 8D and the CF6-50, very minimal activity in the JT9, although there are, from time to time, transactions.  These are not where we are you know spending our time, nor focused.  The engines that we're focused on are more of the later generation equipment, the CFM, and the PW4000, 2000, the V2500 type engines., Yes, very strong.  Very strong., Thank you., Yes, hi Peter., What we see in the early stages of an operation.  So for instance, when, if you look back at Oklahoma, accepting – when they first accepted a certain category of aircraft, what you'll find is that the first couple of months are a little less efficient.  You gain about, in the first six months, you gain about 5 – roughly, on an average, 5% efficiency each month.  It takes about 6 months to get you know real efficient.  So I think if you use a similar guideline here, you're going to be a little less efficient in the first few months, and then you'll continue to get efficiency.  As we gain the efficiencies, I would expect the operating margins, particularly in light of the cost structure of that business unit, to be favorable from current standpoint, and probably favorable from a historical vantage point as well., The key, Peter, incidentally, if you look at our MR numbers, margin numbers, the key there is loading, and we have a challenge out to our businesses; and we're trying to have our businesses work the supply businesses where we are seeing some strength.  We're close with the component businesses to try to drive more component work, and we met with them success here this quarter, and we expect to meet with some success here in the balance of the year.  The key to that business is loading and getting volumes up.  If we get the volumes up, we can have tremendous impact on the corporation's bottom line; and I would expect that as we're – kind of the trend that we're seeing, as well as some of the firepower that we're putting into the marketplace in this respect, that we'll start seeing some traction here.  I think I mentioned in the last conference call, I was expecting some improvement in the component repair business.  We did get some of that improvement, and we should start – we should see more of that coming forward you know third quarter and fourth quarter out into the future., Greg, actually, we mentioned that we had had some sales of some aircrafts during the period, we had acquired towards the latter part of fiscal '04.  We had acquired some aircraft, some older aircrafts from TACA down in South America.  And we acquired 10 aircrafts.  We sold some of those aircrafts during the first quarter.  And then we sold pretty much the balance, I think there's one aircraft remaining, during the second quarter.  So, that had a positive impact on those results.  We also acquired some aircraft for lease with our joint venture.  And we expect some revenue or income pickup, I should say, from that activity through the balance of the fiscal year.  And as we continue to acquire more assets, we're thinking that that business will once again become a nice contributor to the overall product mix.  There's two ways to look at the aircraft business from AAR – there's two ways that we look at it.  One is obviously, the income that it generates on its own.  But secondly, for instance, one of the aircraft that we recently acquired will go through the Indianapolis maintenance center for repairs, so we should capture a fair amount of maintenance in-house.  We're seeing the aircraft leasing business as a feeder for some of the other things that we do here inside the company.  So that's part of our strategy., That's correct., Yes, you'll see – what you'll see is you'll see income from the lease stream and from time to time we will sell when the conditions are right and the – there is somebody who wants to own the asset more than we do.  You'll see from time to time, you'll see us selling those assets as well., Yes.  Most of the acquisitions will be with our joint venture partner.  This is a very large internationally renowned financial institution based in New York, who prefers to be referred to confidentially., So this entity, together with ourselves, has been going into the marketplace and buying assets.  And these assets are – we're carrying them on a joint venture basis.  So 50-50 joint venture, AAR receives certain fees and step-ups based on performance, and we're carrying these in that fashion, so we bring the – the income is recorded on our P&L.  There is no sales treatment for these assets.  So, we expect the contribution margin to be, as time goes on, more meaningful.  Today it's relatively insignificant.  And from a sales standpoint, it will not be effective., Yes, that's correct., The acquisition, the repair, the lease, and the sale., No, I'm sorry.  The MRO revenue would come – would flow through AAR.  I'm sorry, in that respect.  What I meant is, that the joint venture may acquire assets that require maintenance.  AAR would then receive the maintenance work for those assets, as long as AAR maintains a competitive pricing structure., No, we may have other partners, depending on the size of the opportunities.  It may require us to seek out other equity players.  There are interested parties in joining up in this respect.  So there may be other partners that we bring to the table.  And there may be other ventures with different category or classes of aircraft., It's limited to certain types of aircraft and we have explored with this partner.  We have explored assets outside of the framework.  But we also, as I indicated Greg, we also have had interest from other investment companies as well., Ok. Thanks., I don't think there was any meaningful change in that regard, I believe we continue to give a good accounting for ourselves in this market.  I think we've won our fair share of business.  We will be – we have been selected for a group of components from one of the legacy carriers that I guess is taking some market share, but that work won't commence until the third quarter.  But I would say that on balance, we're holding our own., My belief is that you have a few different things going on at the same time.  One is you have, you know, you mentioned earlier about the older technology aircraft, on the engine side at least.  And then on the aircraft side, you have components that have been – or aircraft that have been cannibalized, replacing spare sales as well as replacing component opportunities, repair opportunities., I believe that most of that cannibalization has – you know, it clearly has slowed down.  I won't say it's not there any longer, but it has slowed down.  I think we'll see – we'll be a beneficiary of fewer of those situations.  Secondly, we have really sharpened our focus on this market.  We have combined some of the activities with our supply companies.  As a matter of fact, come next year, we'll be showing our business as a little bit different, because we're really going to the market today more in the parts – as a parts unit, which includes the supply, the PMA, and the repair, and we expect some traction from that move.  And you know, thirdly you have legacy carriers and other folks looking to outsource in a way that they may have not in the past, and we believe we'll be a beneficiary, at least with two major US legacy carriers here in this fiscal year., So, I think if you look at all three trends, if you will, I think they all bode very positively for the component repair business.  Now keep in mind, our component repair businesses have really been at a historical low point, and you know we maintain basically the same infrastructure, the same skill sets.  We continue to make investments in that business to get newer technology repair activities coming through those businesses.  So I believe that you will see consistent, steady, and maybe even acute growth from those businesses here, moving forward., Thank you., Third and fourth quarters., We expect that that business should start showing some growth in the third quarter, so yes.  Now, keep in mind, Tom, it has been, from an income standpoint, it's been showing improved results now for quite some time.  From a – purely from a selling – sales standpoint, we should start seeing year-over-year favorables by third quarter and we should start seeing some meaningful growth starting in the beginning of next fiscal year., Yes, we're pretty encouraged by the backlog, so we believe that the environment is still friendly for those businesses.  We've won some good competitions and we would be fairly optimistic for the results for at least the balance of this year and hopefully out into the out years as well., That will kick in – that should start kicking in in the January-February timeframe., No, that's by way of comparison with the year ago., We have had a order pickup since September 1, although we're not overly bullish on the business, the business should do better in the balance of this fiscal year.  We should have improved results in second, third, and fourth quarter over first quarter., Thank you, Tom., Good morning., Okay, so the – we have begun the hiring process.  We've hired a few of the staff positions.  We expect to be operational the second half of November, optimistically, realistically, the middle of December.  We are in discussions with a few different potential start-up customers and we have a broad interest with customers from this market.  We will – we are shooting for FAA Certification by the end of October, early November, so I believe we're on schedule, we're on our schedule, and we are, we're still, we're very optimistic about the results from that business., It is, Peter.  It's due to the foreign sales corporation, the benefit we receive there., And the higher margins on that business., Right., Right., No, we're continuing to drive for margin improvement, Peter.  We think that margins should improve as we progress throughout the fiscal year., Yes, CapEx in the quarter was $3.6 million.  For the year we expect to be on approximately that run rate in the $14 million range and that's primarily -the CapEx is primarily in areas of capability for the company.  In terms of working capital, inventory was up approximately $2 million in the quarter.  Receivables were down approximately $7 million and payables were down approximately $6 million., Yes, yes, that's correct., 737, one 737, one A310., Yes., Well, as we've indicated, we've had good success in the – particularly the Asian and European markets, so yes, we've benefited from trends in outsourcing.  We didn't highlight the domestic market, but the domestic market is up slightly for the company and we, although I don't think we've won anything that would be other than what we've communicated through press releases, we have some meaningful projects that we're working on right now, so we would anticipate some good stuff coming in this regard here shortly, and I believe the Indianapolis facility will help us.  You know, part of our problem on the MRO side, part of our problem on the airframe maintenance side is that we've been running fairly much at capacity in our Oklahoma City facility, so we haven't been able to solicit any large-scale customers or business opportunities.  We haven't been able to compete.  But now with the space coming on board there in Indianapolis, we should be in a very good position to compete for that business., Well, I think when we refer to as a low-cost provider, what we're really referring to is in comparison with the airline shops., So, you know, we'd be comparing ourselves, basically, with the broad market.  We have very competitive labor rates in relationship to the airlines, very competitive benefit packages, and, you know, we have very favorable work rules, so those all work in our favor to make us a lower-cost provider.  We can offer rates in Oklahoma, for instance, and we should be able to do the same in Indianapolis, that are really very competitive in the market., Yes, Singapore Technologies, Lufthansa Technik, Pemco – those would be the three that come to mind., Yes., It was a combination of the converts and the '07 public notes., Thank you., One of our – keep in mind that Oklahoma City, our Oklahoma City facility is somewhat, you know, how should I say, impacted by the fact that it doesn't have that much hangar space, so when we have – we can only take so many commitments for work into that facility, so if you look at the quarter that just ended, one of our customers which we were expecting to see work from actually flew their aircraft – had a busier summer season than they expected, so they kept the aircraft flying, so the impact on the business was somewhat meaningful and contributed to the decline on a year-over-year basis., Absolutely not, it was purely – as a matter of fact, the shop today is full up again.  Starting right around September 15, it got, we were filled up again., And it's one of the drivers behind the Indianapolis strategy, was that we really found ourselves in a position where we couldn't expand much in Oklahoma City.  We couldn't take on new business, to build a new hanger would take us a year and a half to two years, and the Indianapolis facility was available, so we were able to move on that opportunity., Not noticeably.  Our team has done a great job in this respect.  We have – first of all I think we have the best team in the industry, and you know our guys have put in, have done, I think have done a remarkable job at turning that business around since 9/11, and I think this quarter's results go ahead and signify the progress they've made, so I believe we have a very good position in that market., Well, I'm not sure that the market is a – necessarily the type of market that somebody would want to enter today.  There are fewer players who can pay their bills, and the guys who can pay their bills have been forging closer relationships with suppliers they can depend upon, and I think we're in a good position there to continue to build the relationships with the airlines that are viable airlines., It's approximately 35% military in the quarter."
1004,2005.0,Q&A,a,"Well, we saw strong activity across most of our product lines, particularly in our traditional after-market support, with our after-market support products.  We also had strength across different regions: North America, Europe and Asia., We saw good growth in Europe and we saw good growth in Asia for this business, and we also had good performance in North America.  But the business itself, you know, is recovering from, you know, the traumas of 9/11, and we anticipate that that business will continue to grow and get back to, you know, more historical levels., Well, you know, you'd be looking at, you know, let me get back to you with those numbers specifically.  But you'd be looking at still considerable improvement., Sure.  I'll give you the gross profit and the gross profit percentage., In the inventory and logistics, the gross profit was $14,250,000 or 19.8%, MRO was $6,961,000 or 13.1%, manufacturing was $9,591,000, 18.5, and Aircraft and Engine Sales and Leasing was $130,000 or breakeven for a total of 15.6.  And if you adjust for the aircraft sale, Peter, the $15 million aircraft sale, the adjusted gross margin would be 16.9% for the quarter., Applies for that transaction., The first plane is in the barn now, and is undergoing maintenance., I believe that all four by the summer., I think we add a second line next month, a third line the following month, and the fourth line by the summer., A very interesting group of customers interested in putting maintenance through Indianapolis.  We've had quite a few customer visits.  Everybody's fairly impressed with the facility and the team that we've put together, so we would anticipate other wins, you know relatively shortly for that facility., First part of the question is, I believe we do have a certificate for the A320.  The second part of the equation I don't have – question I don't have the answer., Yes, it is., And we also had a reduction in our overall inventory position, in addition to the sale of the aircraft.  We did have a increase in receivables in the quarter, Jay, driven by the increased sales, but also driven by fewer collection days in the month of February., Yes., Yes, D&A was $7.4 million, and CapEx was $2.7 million., Well, I think, you know we're benefiting from the demand for conversions, and we think that there's a lot of opportunity for us to grow our cargo business.  I think there's going to be more announcements coming., We should have four bays, possibly five bays running by the summer., I think that's the way to look at it, yes., Good morning, Tom., Well, the specialized cargo products that you're referring to are a significant part of the manufacturing business, and that business in the quarter had growth, albeit somewhat modest, but still experienced sales growth.  We had a fairly strong growth in the cargo, commercial cargo products, and we had good growth in the specialized composite products. So I would anticipate that the specialized products that you're referring to, Tom, will continue to be a significant part of the manufacturing group. The backlog is still very strong in that business, and you know I see no reason why that won't continue to be a significant piece of the manufacturing business., But at the same time I think you could expect to see growth coming out of the other products in that group as well., You'd probably be looking at somewhere in the vicinity of 400 people at that point.  And how much higher it can go will obviously it would depend on how successful we are deploying the balance of the bays.  But we have our plans, calls for us to have as many as 1,100, 1,200 people there once we are fully occupying the facility., Correct., OK., The debt that we paid down was specifically related to an aircraft joint venture that we had, as well as a small IRB.  And we did not repurchase any bonds during the quarter., We are monitoring our capital structure.  We are tuned in to what's available in the market, and it's something that we are looking at on a regular basis., The revenues in the quarter were very modest because we only had one or two aircraft in there.  They were joint venture aircraft.  And we don't really expect any start-up costs in the fourth quarter of any significance., That is correct., No.  Equipment on long-term lease., Well, we expect that the effective tax rate for the remainder of this fiscal year will be in the 20% range.  Going forward, because of the impact of the changes in the tax law, we expect our tax rate will increase.  We haven't pegged it for next fiscal year yet, and I expect that we'll be in a position to do that on the next call., Hi, Greg.  How are you?, I think what you're seeing going forward, Greg, is that the company is more interested in investing alongside of other investors, so that you'll see that, for instance, in the quarter, we invested in four aircraft, together with a joint venture partner.  We will continue to look to monetize the fleet that we had pre-9/11, let's say, and at the same token, we'll continue to look for advantageous buys going forward with partners., We have been approached by a party in that respect.  We have not been able to consummate any transactions.  If the right opportunity came along, Greg, in that respect, we would explore it., Yes, the idea is that together we will fund advantageous purchases and then we'll go ahead and either purchase aircraft that are either in place, which case we might have a slightly lower return, or we will purchase aircraft on a let's call it more of a speculative basis, in which case we would be looking for a higher return.  And we are looking at a wide array of aircraft types in this regard, and we believe we've made some very prudent investments the last six months in this area.  Based on where the market's at today, we think there are some additional opportunities in this market, so we're actually quite encouraged and we like the idea we're able to attract partners who have deeper pockets than we do and are eager to play in this market and have chosen AAR to go ahead and go into the market with., Well, as you can see in the period just ended, we had fairly broad success across the different product areas, the ILS, the Inventory Logistics Service segment, had nice growth, double-digit growth.  The MRO business experienced double-digit growth and the manufacturing business experienced double-digit growth.  As I look out into the future, obviously the MRO business should be very positively impacted by the move into the Indianapolis maintenance facility so I would anticipate very clearly that we would experience double-digit growth in MRO. I believe the same dynamics exist in the inventory business so I would anticipate, moving forward, that we'll continue to experience double-digit growth out of that group as well and then manufacturing is, I believe we're in a very solid position across the different product lines that we have and I think that that business also should grow in a double-digit fashion., On the aircraft and engine sales and leasing business, I believe that the results of these joint venture investments we've made that at least the earnings flow from that business will be more predictable, and I also would expect a meaningful improvement, particularly on the earnings side, coming from that business going forward.  Now because of joint venture accounting, we may not be recording as much sales growth because the sales will not come through the sales line but that aside, the activity in that market should be a lot stronger for the company and the earnings contribution from that business, I think you may have heard Tim say earlier, for the third quarter, the business did not contribute to the profitability of the company but we would expect that, as we look out next year and beyond as we continue to build a very attractive portfolio of aircraft together with partners, that we would expect this business to contribute very nicely to the profitability of the company., I think that's a good way to put it and I think if you look at the quarter's results, a 24% sales growth is, I think, a fairly healthy sales growth number and even if you were to back out the aircraft transaction, you still have 15% sales growth and that takes into consideration, also, that we sold an operation that took sales from a comparative standpoint takes sales out of the equation.  So yeah, I believe that you're seeing to some degree there's been a coming out of the trough, if you will, and I don't think it's too dissimilar to what we experienced in the early '90s, only we're 10 years smarter., No, that's all of the – it's primarily the increase in our mobility business., The increase started in the third quarter a year ago., Right, exactly., Thank you., It does and we can't., Just bear with us for a second., Jay, you want me to call you back with it?, Thank you., We had approximately $950,000 in the quarter related to Indianapolis, which we didn't have in the third quarter.  And then, the special items that we referred to in our press release related to the pension curtailment and the stock options also impacted SG&A in the quarter., 1.8 million, I believe., Correct, that is correct., Yes?, If you look at the – from the past, we included our component repair business as part of MRO.  In the future and in practice, we have been teaming our component businesses with our parts supply businesses to offer more supply chain solutions, so that we are managing the business in that fashion.  We believe we have a powerful combination, combining the parts with the component repair, unique offering for the industry. And we just felt it would give a better picture, clearer picture, to the industry of our progress in this area, or lack thereof if that happens to be, but we believe it's fairly reflective of how we intend to run the business going forward.  On the Structures and System, which used to be largely MRO, I mean, manufacturing, basically, we are looking at more service and spare parts support opportunities in that segment so that the main manufacturing didn't really define what we were doing in that area any longer.  Structures and Systems are more akin I guess, to the actual activity and it includes designing, engineering, manufacturing, as well as after sales support, so that we – the adjustment – that's principally an adjustment in name., We used to combine Aircraft and Engine Sales and Leasing; we've taken the engine piece of the business, we have moved that over into the Aviation Supply segment. And we have really identified aircraft from a sales and leasing perspective on a standalone basis. We have attracted outside partnership financial partners to share in the – on a going forward basis investments we are making in the aircraft arena. So again, more accurately reflective of how we view the business going forward. MRO with the addition of Indianapolis, we want to put more of a focus and a spotlight on the MRO businesses. So, if you look at the heavy maintenance businesses that we have with the company, you're looking at the Oklahoma City operation, the recently added Indianapolis operation, and our landing gear business. So that would be the rationale behind the alignment., Cash flow from operations for the year was 51 million., And CapEx was 13 million., Thank you., Good morning, Jay., Yeah. I believe that is how we are viewing it, Jay. And I think we try to signal that as much in the release by talking about gaining market share. I don't believe that this market is growing at 26%., So I believe it's – market share, I think it's shifting in terms of airlines focus more along the lines of outsourcing and I think it is some of our – due to some of our alignment in terms of the service offerings that we're bringing to the market., Well, my general view is that we are making great progress in the commercial airline markets.  That's somewhat mitigated by the state of the U.S. commercial airline market.  I mean, we're anticipating come the end of the summer that there may be some disruptions in the U.S. airline commercial market in light of the consistent pressure on fuel costs.  But I think, notwithstanding short-term issues that might evolve come fall, winter months, as a result of this continued pressure, I believe that you should be expecting consistent double-digit growth coming out of the commercial markets from the company., Well, I would say, I would feel comfortable just referring to it in double digits., I think in terms of on top of end markets, I can't necessarily say, but definitely I feel confident that we can continue to grow this piece of our business in a very healthy fashion going forward., I think it can maintain it's sales level.  I think it may have some fluctuation up or down.  I think that clearly we benefited from some surge activity in that market but at the same token, we've continued to build new products in that area.  Our shelter business is very strong, as you can tell the pallet business, obviously, should be strong for the period of time you indicated.  Low pressure on containers because that was more clearly a benefit of surge activity, but nevertheless on a across the board basis that business should continue to perform well.  I think the key ingredient in that business gives us a very healthy return on our investment, and should continue to do so into the foreseeable future., You know, if you look back in time, historically there's been a decline in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter largely due to the summer flying activity of the commercial customers.  I am not sure that  that pattern – I am sure if that pattern continues or not.  Clearly, we should have a nice increase over the prior year quarter-over-quarter, but I'm not sure how it will translate fourth quarter to first quarter.  I don't have enough visibility at this point., I have segment gross profit; Inventory and Logistics for the fourth quarter, 15.970 million or 18%; Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul 10.080 million, 15.5; Manufacturing 8.084 million, 16.1; and Aircraft and Engine Sales and Leasing 960,000, 17.2., Good morning, Peter., Well I think that, Peter, as we continue to grow the top line, we continue to see opportunities for leveraging our cost structure.  So we think it's reasonable that our margins continue to improve as our volumes improve., 25 to 30, Peter., Yes and also the impact of the changes in the tax law depending on the manufacturing content of our revenues those types of thing., No., Peter, we're out there on the joint venture front on – from a couple of different perspectives.  One is on the service side; obviously, we have the startup of our joint venture in Malaysia.  We are also looking at a component – form a component joint venture in the Asian market.  We are also looking to continue to invest in aircraft through the joint ventures.  So we feel it's wise to keep our powder dry and keep generating cash, and keep building up a stockpile.  At the same token – same time, one of our stated goals is to increase the OE contents of the products that we offer into the industry.  We think because of our knowledge of the after-markets that we can combine the OE with the after-market activity and build a very powerful Structures and Systems business.  So it is possible that we may look to make acquisitions that make sense as well., Yeah., Thank you., Thanks Tom, good to hear your voice., We should – revenues should continue to increase in Indianapolis.  At this moment, I wouldn't want to necessarily put out my expectation versus – excuse me, what we're actually experiencing.  But I think that we should see steady revenue increases coming out of Indianapolis., Yes we will have some NRE expense over the next couple of years.  Revenues won't kick in until '07. So we are expecting NRE in the 20 million range spread out, I believe, over a three-year period or a two-year period., Tom that would go to the balance sheet until the program – until we start to deliver against the program., Yes, we grew our inventory by 6.  We did sell one during the period., No.  It's a one-time item related to the change in the plan., It will not cost more., Thank you., We're expecting – the numbers that you are referring to are from our fiscal '07 through fiscal '015., Right., We don't expect to have to account for stock option – we are not issuing any new stock options and we don't expect to have to have this accounting convention for stock options in the future.  And the split is approximately 40% of the total related to the pension and 60% related to the stock option expense., Yes, that's correct., Performance-based restricted stock., We'll be issuing – last year we issued a historical level similar to what we've done historically.  Last year issue was a two-year program, so we will not be issuing significant numbers of shares this year.  There are – we will be identifying throughout our company what we call high potential employees who in the past maybe haven't received stock grants, but if you take a look at the names, 5 executives, for instance, highly – most highly paid executives will not be receiving any stock this year as part of the – at least as part of the annual plan., So there will be no – there will be very minimal, this year at least, other than if there are any special events.  From an annual vantage point, there will be significantly less this year than we have in the past.  Less than – approximately 100,000 shares., And so there will be no stock options.  There are – there is no plan for stock options at this point., Hi, Greg., Greg, the ideal situation for us is where we can get to the point where we're operating approximately 7 hangars – 7 bays.  Right now we're operating 3 bays.  The business starts really working for the company when we get up to 7.  Obviously, we need to win more business to get to that point.  Keep in mind now, we received FAA certification in the latter part of '04.  We began hiring mechanics in January.  We were successful in winning one contract.  We've had other work that has dropped in, but really we're, I believe, from an operational standpoint, we've made some great headway.  And now we have to get our story out into the marketplace and capture more business so we can get to the point where we get the number of bays that really start making financial sense for the company., That would be correct.  We need more business to expand the number of bays that we're operating out of., Right now it's – we have the right level, the right amount of hangars.  We need to win more business so we can get more hangars, so we can utilize more hangars., It's – military is approximately 37% of sales for the quarter and for the year, Greg., Yes., Well, I think we commented earlier that on the sales growth in the commercial business being in the double digits and military probably slightly less than that., Greg, if you look at the company, and you've been following the company for a long time, if you go back before 9/11, military revenues were approximately 17, 18% of total revenues.  Since 9/11, obviously military became a larger percentage of the total mix of business.  This year, it will probably be the first year that we've had – since 9/11, it's probably the first 12-month period that we've had stronger growth commercially than we have selling to the defense markets.  I believe going forward, you'll probably see greater growth coming from the commercial markets, but that's just kind of sense.  And I think that we should be – we should see the military – I mean, the ideal defense mix for the company, in my view, is somewhere between 35 and 45%., I think we are at the lower end from a – from where we'd like to be going forward., I don't think so., No, the engines are wholly owned by the company., Whatever engines we have at this point., All the new investments are coming through partnerships.  We still have some legacy aircraft from before.  Let's say there's some aircraft still remaining from before 9/11.   And from time to time we may buy aircraft on our own account, but most of the business that we intend to do at least would be through joint ventures., Nothing that I can see at this point.  But you know it is hard to tell exactly what happens in our industry.  If fuel continues to stay at this level, I can't be totally certain what the financial viability of some of our customers may be.  But at this point, we feel that we don't see – we don't have any sense that there is other problems out there., That's correct., For Aviation Supply Chain, for the fourth quarter?, 21.504 million, or 18.6%., Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul, 5.164 million, 14.1%., Structures and systems, 8.545 million, 16%.  And Aircraft essentially breakeven., Well, I think it is just related to one or two particular transactions., Right.  Right., We are., Thank you., Good morning., The A400 margins in the beginning will be less than we've experienced, until we – really the spare parts piece kicks in at which point in time the margins should be similar to what we've experienced.  So I believe in the early years you may have a little bit of margin compaction.  As the program starts moving along, you should start seeing traditional margins.  And hopefully at some point in time, if the Airbus build is higher than we've estimated and it looks like it's a very strong aircraft, then you'll start seeing margins stronger than we've historically experienced., The Air Force contract will be historical margins., Yes., No, just I think the comments we're making are not related to what there may be in the way of expectations.  I think we're just trying to give color as to how we see the world.  So, we've had a lot of momentum here as a company, and yet at the same time, we remain a little bit concerned particularly here in the U.S. domestic market with the financial condition of many of the airline players.  So we just want to be balanced in our view of the world., Yes., Yes., I don't – I'm not really highlighting a weakness.  I think what I'm – what we're saying is that, hey, we've got a lot of momentum here at the company.  The business environment has been relatively – has been improved, let's say, from how it was in the periods closed more preceding the 9/11 events. And all we're saying is that as we look out, we have some caution in light of the impact of high fuel prices on our airline customer results.  And of course you already have some of our airline customers are in somewhat of a precarious financial condition.  So we just want to – we're not – at this point in time, we're not seeing any weakness. We're just aware that the markets we are in are potentially choppy here coming off after the summer flying season., Thank you., The only program Jed that requires..., Peter, I am sorry Peter requires ongoing investment would be the A400M at this point.  There is some additional investment in Mesa, but it's really spread out over a 10-year period, but we would anticipate the cash flows from Mesa going out from here to be very positive, and the cash flows in the UK MOD should be positive.  And the only, the A400M, keep in mind now, we are in the development stage today and that program will not start contributing sales and earnings until the end of '07., In fact the majority investments required for the other programs are pretty much behind us., Yeah I think Peter we are seeing good deal flow.  Keep in mind now the latest contract is just signed on November 22nd, so it's coming operational as we speak.  I believe the organization that we have strength in the organization, enough strength to go ahead and attract some additional programs, and we are in discussions with numerous parties not just regional carriers but also other larger carriers as well.  We also anticipate and we are looking at some opportunities on the defense side as well in this area.  So the deal flow is strong, and I believe as we execute here on the existing deals that we should be able to capture additional programs of this nature., Yeah it should be completed this fiscal year.  It might, might lean over a little bit into next fiscal year., Yes., I think that level is a strong level.  I think the trend is for improving margins in that area.  There was some favorable mix but also as we get our compelling shops get filled with more work, margins in that group improve.  So, I would, I would be hopeful the margins is not quite at the same level, that will be very close than before, they will be branding , Yeah, so if you look at our facilities today, I do not believe we have any facilities operating at full capacity.  Oklahoma City probably comes the closest to being a full capacity, but Indianapolis clearly has room for more growth, our landing gear shop can handle more work, and our component shops can handle more work, manufacturing plants, one or two might be a little stretch but for the most part, we do have additional capacity to handle the sales growth, as we start experiencing the sales growth, that should drive improved margin., Yeah, we are expecting the margin to continue to improve.  So, we feel fairly compliant , That's what we are looking at.  Yes., Well we continue to add people, we continue to hire people in Indy.  Our biggest constraint right now would be getting people up the speed.  And as we attract qualified mechanics and putting through our training regiment, I think there is a kind of balance if you will, that should allow us see steady growth coming out of that facility.  The phasing factor obviously we have floor space.  The phasing factor is attracting and retaining qualified mechanics.  And we are working hard and diligently in that respect, we got some success.  We had a nice increase in business flow to that facility this past 90 day period.  We are expecting continued growth, the balance of the fiscal year, should be steady, and consistent.  The one thing that is very important part is, everybody keep in mind is, now this operation is not up and running a full-year yet.  So the success that we have experienced in this facility I think it's remarkable.  We don't want to get ahead or ourselves here.  We want to continue to build the quality product, stayed focused on the things that customers are looking for.  And I believe as we continue to build in this fashion we will end with a very successful enterprise., I say there is a balance.  We are able to find a labor that we need.  If all of a sudden somebody dumps another 500 employees on us, we could ramp up, that much quicker in that operation, but the same token, its very important that these folks will be trained properly and learn our system and I don't see any reason why we can't continue to grow at the rate that you have seen us grow the last, 90 and 120 days in this business., Yeah that's about approximately 50:50., Slightly less as we go into the third quarter and slightly less than the fourth quarter but still fairly meaningful., Yes, as we look at different markets then we look at different capabilities.  There are clearly voiced in our portfolio.  So, like for instance there are more things we would like to offer the regional markets.  I believe we made some very good progress in supporting regional carriers.  And, of course as we have talked about over the past, regional carriers would be the binders, not necessarily having heavy investments, and maintenance and supply.  So, the planes are our strength.  And, as we see the regional carriers growing in market share, that's a segment that we want to continue to play in.  So, I could see adding additional service capabilities by capability in support of that market.  We also, as I look at our structures and systems area, I think there is room for growth in the mobility world, both in terms of providing more value to our customers, and by also, by being a little further up the food chain, but also being a little further down the food chain as well in terms of some of the things that are stuffing for the shelters and having the capability to built some of that equipment.  I also see the aircraft parts business expanding for the company, I think that we could manufacture like for instances as we plan out the demand for the A400 systems.  We recognize there is a, going to be a large appetite for machining and building many of those of parts are going for the systems.  And, we are exploring possibilities and having more of that capability under our umbrella.  So, Jay I think there are a lot of different areas for us to go ahead and expand, through smart acquisitions., Yep., We are spending a fair amount of time developing that strategy as we speak today.  We are bit, still continue to place a lot of emphasis.  Our products are being received quite well in that market.  And we are fairly bullish on having more presence in that market.  We are looking very close in China.  As you know last year, or year and a half ago, we opened up an office in Shanghai.  It is now staffed with 4 folks, who are not jut covering the customer base from the selling standpoint, but also looking at the strategy for the company in that market.  We also see the Malaysian market as a very friendly market for the company and one in which we hopefully will be growing our presence.  So Asia, Asia is a very broad geographic region.  And we're developing different strategies over different pieces of that region., Yeah of course, it's, there is, clearly a piece of our business today is what we would refer to as surge activity the activity that the US defense forces are currently engaged in.  But if you look at the long-term strategy for the US defense forces, you can study the Rumsfeld plan, it's really to have a smaller more mobile fighting force.  And although the Iraqi issue may get solved at some point in time, there probably would be other places around the world that the US will either be engaged in or will need to be prepared to be engaged in.  So the products that we build are really designed to assist in the effort to move products and supplies into the various periods of operations at any given point in time.  So, this world is very far from being a safe place, and we feel very confident that the product line that we currently enjoy is very well positioned to deal with the overall geopolitical environment that we're currently faced with.  At the same time, we think that there are various ways for us to grow this, our position in this market that can transcend, any, not just this difficultly, but any other difficulties by virtue of making ourselves more important, a more important supplier and a more value-added supplier., That's so, Jay, if you take a look at the company today versus the company say 2 or 3 years ago, today much more of our business is contract-based, just a little bit more forecastable.  And our goal is to, as we sit here and plan all our future is to win more of that type of business.  I believe that the products we have, the services we provide will allow us to attract very predictable stream of business for very sustainable period of time.  So I am encouraged with the prospect, I am encouraged by the position that the company has, I prefer at this point in time not really to dive into specific forecast.  We will, our management team, our leisure team will be meeting in January to talk about the, not just the 6 months that past, but the 6 months ahead of us, and then start the foundation for the next 12-month period in front of that.  So, I will be in much better position to address the next, the '07 period in the next 45 days than it might be today., I think you're going to see from the order we just announced you're going to see most of the – you're going to see the impact begin in the second quarter., It should run at a smooth rate for the balance the fiscal year., Yes, fairly minimal.  There will probably be, there should be no SG&A impact.  There may be some additional indirect expense, but for the most part there shouldn't be much in the way of incremental expenses., Yes, you had probably small impact in Q1, but you have both programs ramp up in Q2 and out into the future., I think you'll see in the first couple of years it starts really kicking up, gearing up in the third year.  You still have pretty decent revenues in years 1 and 2., The first part of the question is that we would anticipate that there will be some additional build, and once we get a year or so under our belt, we'll have a much better handle in terms of what the inventory requirements to support these fleets might be.  So I would anticipate that early on you get some build and then a little later on you get a reduction.  I think in terms of additional deals, obviously if we can tap into the CRJ markets and the ERJ markets to a broad extent, we should be able to use this inventory to leverage additional opportunities., As we look to support fleets different than, say, the CRJ and ERJ, then we may be in a similar mode of having to invest in inventory., Well, yes, but we also have increase in inventory turns as well.  So, for us to get from 3.0 to 3.6, we need to not just be turning receivables, but we also need to be turning inventory.  So inventory turn increase is up about 20%, from roughly 2 to 2.5, give or take, in the quarter., Morning, Peter., Well, we haven't necessarily seen a ramp up necessarily as a result of the strike.  We have been seeing a ramp up in activity with Northwest that's been dating back for, say, the last 6 months.  Maybe in preparation of a strike, I'm not sure, but I believe that Northwest has been looking, searching for ways to lower their cost of operations.  We've been recipients as a result of a couple of successful competitions in component repair.  We are doing some maintenance for Northwest, project oriented in Indianapolis, and we would expect that as time marches on here that we'll see more opportunities develop from Northwest.  Northwest is very pleased with the service they are receiving from AAR, and as they look to outsource  more of the things they do, we should be a beneficiary., Yes., Yes, I mean it's okay.  We are doing some work for ATA, but we have done, I think we have performed mod work on one aircraft maybe two, and we continue to watch the ATA account very closely., United is very pleased.  Myself and a couple of other senior leaders have met with senior folks from United very recently.  They are very pleased with the service and support they are getting from the company, and they are looking to put additional aircraft types on their ticket for AAR to support.  So I would expect that the United relationship, which is solid today, will continue to grow., We didn't put it in a press release.  It's 180 million., I believe it was 160 million, Peter., Thank you.  Peter, it was 189 million at August and it was 160 million at May 31., What we did was we managed our exposure.  I wouldn't say that we did anything special in terms of protection, but we matched our cash coming in with our goods going out., We assume, on pre-petition receivables that we're only going to get paid a fraction of the pre-petition amount.  And on post-petition, our history has been that we've been paid dollar-for-dollar., Well, in the quarter that just ended, we put up a small, relatively small, reserve for our pre-petition exposure to Delta and Northwest., We feel pretty confident that in this case we recognized the full loss., When they filed, yes., I think we'll be right., We're not going to get much., Yes, well, we've – as we've announced, we have entered into one formalized joint venture, which is over the last year or so, we've added 7 or 8 airplanes to that venture and we are in discussions with another party on another venture today, which will probably add another 6 or 7 aircraft to our portfolio., You're welcome., Jay, first of all, the pipeline's very strong.  The, obviously, we've announced some major wins here recently.  We'll be in the process here in the current period of ingesting the programs we've recently announced.  While at the same time, we believe that the model is very compelling for other carriers and we're seeing increased interest.  If I were to compare the flow today to, say, a year ago, I'd say it's considerably stronger., In relationship to Malaysia, the AIROD venture is progressing pretty much on schedule.  We have received gear in already.  We've received two gear that come into our Malaysia operations.  We expect full certification sometime in October.  Hopefully our VP of Engineering, Mickey Cohen, will be visiting with the FAA during that time period.  Hopefully secure that – secure the certifications and we would expect business to be fairly brisk coming out of that region., We had a margin increase in the quarter., Minimally.  As we've said., Yes, I think that's about right.  You assume you might get 10 cents on the dollar., Right., We're very bullish on – we're very bullish on the regional jets.  We support the regional jets and our MRO facilities.  Both from a heavy maintenance vantage point as well as landing gear.  We also have inventory positions to support our regional jet growth.  And we have component repair capability for that market as well.  And I believe that's one of the reasons why MESA selected us for this very important program., I think each situation is different.  So I can't say a blanket standpoint, but I think you know the margins are appealing."
1004,2006.0,Q&A,a,"Arnie it was 23.7%., Arnie what I would say is that as Indianapolis comes online, we expect the profitability to improve; as you know we've added significant increase in sales there taking the base up to 6 bays now.  And we expect to see our profit there to improve which will drive the overall improvement in the gross margin for that segment., The 6 bays are being well utilized.  Obviously we can do better, show some improvement.  Our biggest challenge Arnie as we communicated before is getting our team trained and up to speed on our processes and that's been the, I think in the past quarter we added a few more, quite a few more people and we continue to, we expect the margins to improve as a result of the training that we've incurred and better utilization of the bays., You know you had from the standpoint of number of days; you have the smallest/fewest numbers of days in this particular quarter.  Because this quarter is December, which by definition has more days unavailable than most months, as does February, because the calendar only gives it 28 days.  So this quarter which includes both December and February is a shorter quarter than we, than the other 4 quarters might be, the other 3 quarters might be.  So, and there is some seasonality to that business.  We would expect pickup in activity here and that we've seen a pickup of activity here in March.  So, we will expect that pickup to continue., Sure., It's good a question I am not, I would like to let a little bit more time pass before I comment on that.  It was an exceptional quarter from a margin advantage point, it was a good mix.  The programs, very pleased with the execution of the program, got up to speed, faster than we had anticipated.  The expense of the programs is a little bit less than we had anticipated.  So, I would like to hold my comments on that in terms of waiting to see and give little bit more time pass to make the determination how sustainable those margins might be., Yeah, yes.  I would anticipate that the margins will be higher than they've been historically.  But I can't confirm that they would be at this level., I'd like to let a little bit more time pass by., I don't see that yet, I mean, I haven't, we haven't seen that.  We're still, we still have in our component shop which we're seeing a nice improvement we still have, third shift capacity available, and we still have facility space available for expansion.  So, I haven't seen that yet.  So, I think, Peter, we still have capacity to grow., We haven't seen anything yet., Not, I would be unsure at this point.  We are exploring, we are looking closely at the supplemental.  But at this point we, we haven't been notified of anything for us.  Now we are working, we have identified areas were we think there may be opportunity for us and we are exploring them., I believe we received some in last year's supplemental, but I can't confirm, I can get back to you on that., CapEx was $3 million Peter and D&A was 7.6 million., Yes, Accounts Receivables was up due, in part due to the $15 million repurchase of the securitized receivables and also an increase in trade receivables.  The Net Receivable balance at the end of the quarter is 153 million.  Inventory was up 8 million., Thanks., Arnie, over the past several quarters, we've been producing a high volume of containers, under various contracts.  The containers have higher margins than our pallets and our shelters that we produce.  What's happening now is that the demand for, for pallets and shelters has increased and the demand for containers has decreased and so that's impacting our margin in the quarter and we expect that to continue for the next few quarters., There's $17 million of notes outstanding. They are convertible today at option of the note holder., Actually all of these were done by people contacting us., Absolutely, so it's an ""optimize the site"" decision.  We don't pay rent and so we utilize the facility.  So a) Greg what we're trying to do is, go ahead and solidify the current base that we have and get the operating margins to what we expect and then b) is once we are at the level where we want to be go ahead and expand the – move into the other bays.  We are ahead of schedule now.  We were not expecting to be in 6 bays at this point in time.  We were not expecting 700 employees at this time.  Our plan had called for us to have 250 employees at this time, 250-300 employees and we have in excess of 2.5 times as many.  We were thinking at this point in time we would be in 4 bays we are in 6.  So we want to ingest the current work load and then as we solidify the position, go ahead and aggressively merchandize/market remaining capacity., It might come from existing customers not necessarily increasing their numbers as much as giving us an additional fleet type from what we current may enjoy. So it may come from existing customers.  I would think that it would come more from new customers., We entered a joint venture with a local Malaysian company and built a landing gear repair shop in Kuala Lumpur.  We have received a certification from the Malaysian equivalent to the FAA and we have passed the FAA audit.  We're waiting for the actual certificate which should come within the next 30 days at which point in time we will commence operations., What that might do is that might provide lower cost back shop support for our landing gear operation in Miami, which might allow the Miami based operation to grow at a faster rate.  So that would – that could be a potential.  Our goal is to increase our visibility in the Asian market and use that operation as a – to some degree as a store front, to funnel work back to Miami and then do some of the – as time passes on build more capability in Malaysia that we can handle at a lower cost rate in Malaysia.  And it'll also serve – and that's for aircraft, for the gear types that we can't currently handle in Malaysia, gear types that we can currently handle in Malaysia will probably do sub-contract work for the Miami operations., Yeah two big buckets, each one worth 15 million, one is the bulk of what you just said, 15 million each approximately.  We had an aircraft on lease in an off-balance sheet, if you will, synthetic lease arrangement and we acquired that. Interest rate was at a higher rate than we felt we, and plus we are sitting with a pretty good cash position.  So we paid off that loan.  And then we bought back the receivables that we had sold to LaSalle Bank during the period, we bought them back during the period also as result of the cash position of the company.  Also on a interest rate arbitrage if you look at the rate that we are paying for our capital today vs. the interest rate that we were paying on the securitization.  We also increased our inventory in our supply chain group to support not just some of these programs, but also to support our arbitrage business.  And I think basically that's where it-, Plus we had a cash receivable increase due to the sales volumes increase., Yes., Yes., I am not sure, I don't want to pinpoint exactly what the number might be. Let me say that the aircraft that we have been buying are, we think very opportunistic.  We think we will get very meaningful returns on our equity, which is how we are measuring that business.  And we are in the market looking for where we, have an active deal flow.  I'm not sure Greg though that we're going where, that we have things that might close between now and May 31.  But, I would say safely in the next let's call it, 6 month period that you will be in the range of what you've indicated., Yeah primarily, there may be certain situations that develop, where one-off opportunities for us to use our own capital for trading purposes. We are starting to see signs that market may in fact be re-emerging.  So, we might, you might see us do a trade or two on our own account., Yeah, okay., Right on., Depreciation, it was 7.6 million in the quarter.  And I would expect the going forward run rate to be in that same range., Right., We do measure it., I don't know if I – I will tell you, I don't know...., I think it was excellent., EBTA in the quarter was 65 million., No, I am sorry ..., No, no..., 21.6 million., I do.  17.1 million., Yes, diluted shares outstanding were 39.1 million., And they will go to 42.5 million., In the fourth quarter and then, and then stay., In that range., We haven't really put a growth rate out there.  We haven't put our earnings estimates out there., Yeah, I think that we were pleased with the pace of the activity around us.  It's acceptable., I think I'd stick with acceptable., CapEx in the fourth quarter will be between 3.5 and 4 million I would expect., If you look at the North American marketplace, North American marketplace is still I would classify as opportunistic in this respect.  I think although certain of the legacy carriers have placed their aircraft let's say I think they are still kind of working through their longer term decisions on outsourcing.  So my view is that there's still, there's you know I can't tell you percentage wise how many more aircraft are now available for third party maintenance providers today versus how many might be available next year at this time.  Clearly in the last 12 months you've had more of an adjustment than you might have in the next 12 months but there still continues to be an adjustment in this area., If you look at the airplane maintenance that we are focused on that business is mostly narrow body aircraft and typically the carriers wouldn't send a narrow body aircraft across the ocean because there's not enough labor hours to go ahead and justify that kind of transportation cost.  Typically the wide bodies you might be competing more in Asia for wide body maintenance here in North America, but we really haven't dabbled at this point in time in wide bodies.  On the component side again the parts tend to travel in a closer vicinity than going all the way across the pond – either pond might suggest.  Our component shop, incidentally our parts, we don't classify them as part of our MRO operation, we classify them as part of our supply chain business., And but yet at the same time they we have facilities in Europe and – a facility I should say in Europe and we have a facility here in North America principally dealing with the local markets but we do some business in North America for European and Asian carriers and we do some business in Europe for Asian carriers let's say.  But our goal eventually would be to have facility, facilities in Asia to deal with, to handle that market as well.  So, I can't say that we've, I'm unaware of any business that we've lost to a lower cost environment, let's say., Yep., We, the only notes that we have coming, the next note that we have coming due is December '07., So, I mean, we don't have, if people were to call us and tender the notes at par or so we might be interested., Okay., Tim?, Sure.  Arnie,  the aviation supply chain had gross profit of 22.2 million and that's after or including the 4.75 impairment charge that we took.  Maintenance repair and overall was 7.15 million.  Structures and systems was 7.1 million and aircraft was -1.3 million but again that's reflecting the $2.9 million impairment charge., Arnie, I think you've seen the growth in the quarter with 21% so obviously we've connected on some of the things we were hoping for, some of which we're not allowed to announce or not appropriate to announce.  So I think you're going to – the momentum is very positive and I think you should continue to expect very positive momentum., Okay., Okay. So first of all, obviously, we're very pleased with the order we've received from the government.  The particular product that we received this order on is a product that we have a lot of experience on, yet historically has lower margins than some of the other things that we do in that business unit.  So, but we do, based on the size of this contract, we do expect, over the life of the contract, to see the margins improve as we deliver more of these pallets.  In terms of opportunities within the group, the business, the opportunities we're looking at on the Cargo System side continue to be strong.  Obviously we're in the build up mode now for the A400M which we expect to begin deliveries I believe – Tim when do deliveries begin on that again?  Early, the end of this year, early next year?, Yes, early next year., And so, there's, again, in this segment of our business there's a lot of good things going on, and we expect, as the company continues to deliver against its commitments, that we'll see more opportunities present themselves here.  We're very excited about the move into the new facility in North Carolina. It gives us a lot of operating flexibility.  We should contribute, as we get up and running, should contribute to increasing our operating margins for obviously for that business but also should have an impact on the overall margins as well., We knew the possibility was out there.  We were not certain as to whether the funding would be there or not so we put a factor – when we're in these situations where it's either all or nothing, what we do is put a kind of percentage factor as we go into the plan so we factored this in, we probably didn't factor in the full 100% but we did factor in some piece of this contract, yes., Yes., Six., Yes., Yes, I mean, the key here is that we continue to improve on our performance so the customer's experience with AAR continues to improve.  I still think it's very remarkable when you take a look at the landscape that this business unit's been profitable pretty much since its inception, and I believe that we're starting to build up a head of steam.  We have secured business from other customers and I would anticipate, there's always a little bit of a teething experience as a new aircraft and a new customer comes into your facility and we're going through that to some extent with one of our new customers and I would think as we gain that experience that a) we'll have a happy customer, b) we'll make improvements to our earnings and c) we'll continue to attract new people to the balance of the facility., So, yes, we remain – we feel pretty good about that business.  There is some seasonality to that business and there are some, there is a little bit of lumpiness at this stage, as we're in the, still in the formative stages of the business, but I think we have a fair degree of confidence that as time marches on and as we earn our stripes, which I think we're doing, that we'll continue to attract business., The backlog of opportunities continues to be strong and positive for that business.  So we're trying to – and we're in the process of attracting some real high quality names to the facility as opposed to, let's call it the second-tier, financially positioned companies.  The, what's called the cream of the crop, it relates to this industry so yeah we feel we're making progress there., Okay, great, thanks for that color. Just, actually, one more., I would be disappointed if we didn't achieve that or come very close to it by the fourth quarter of this year, which I think is what I signaled last year, so I think if you take all the special items into consideration, or eliminate – if special items haven't occurred in this quarter, obviously we'll be a lot closer.  And we just continue to make progress in that regard so, yeah, I'm relatively optimistic, and some stuff has to happen, and we have to continue to improve our performance, but I think we're clearly heading in that direction., Yeah., We've had some freight success and we also are expecting some passenger success yes. But we have had, we've already signed, we already are performing work for a well regarded freight carrier whose name we're not allowed, we're not suppose to discuss., Yes, I think, you know what it comes down to Peter, is performance and we've had one if not two of their aircraft in our facility, and so far at least through the first aircraft, at least, they expect, they were pleased with our performance results. So we have to get a few more aircraft in and get the efficiencies right and at that point we should have a happy customer, we should have happy shareholders., Landing gear had an exceptionally strong period, Oklahoma is also very strong, and Indy is, I mean, they're all strong, but Oklahoma was – landing gear was particularly strong., Well, it should, we're expecting it to continue, we should, the balance of the fiscal year, based on dialogue, recent dialogue I've had with the business unit, but based on their assessment, based on backlog and their assessment of the market, should be, continue to be a strong year.  And stronger than originally forecasted., So, there's some on a comparative basis, there's some of that, that the – one of the Mesa programs kicked in last August, so you'd have maybe one-third of, two-thirds would not be comparative, and one-third would be, and then the second Mesa program didn't kick in until November.  So you should have another quarter at least of year-over-year improvement because of that.  But in general the business itself, the business has strange cross multiple product lines and it's just in a really good position., Again, I would be disappointed if the growth rate didn't continue in this range, I'm not going to say 19%, but, I think, safely in mid-teens, on a growth rate, I think should be attainable.  And then with some additional wins I think the 20% is clearly in our – on our radar screen., There are more opportunities today, Peter, than I've seen in quite some time and I think part of that is the kind of momentum we're experiencing.  Part of it's what's going on inside the industry and part of it is I think people seeing that the services that we're offering here are effective.  So we've got a few testimonials in this regard from some customers and we're catching the attention of some interesting players at this point., In the 24 million range, Peter., Yes, right, right, right.  The increase in CapEx is due primarily to the building down in North Carolina., Right., Okay. Great. Thank you very much., We're – we should start deliveries, in say, in the latter part of our third quarter, in the, let's call it the February time period., And we expect deliveries to go at least a year, they may go a little longer., All right let me try to provide, if I may, John, just a little color.  I mean if you look at our – we've been in the aircraft business for – since the mid 80s.  But we approached that business up through 9/11 of '01 as a kind of, on our own, if you will, without partners.  Post 9/11, when we saw opportunities we thought that the – we'd be better served – shareholders would be better served if we could find financial partners that would share some of the investment with us, and of course, at that point in time, the profile may have been a little bit riskier.  And we were looking, obviously, to tap into people who had deeper pockets than we did.  So the company has, since we started down that path, we've made numerous investments in aircraft through the joint venture vehicles, primarily.  And we – our business model in this respect is one that's somewhat opportunistic on the buy and opportunistic on the sale., During the period we have an opportunity a)to expand our fleet, and b) to sell off some assets that we thought the timing was right and we could get a nice, very healthy return.  We're very return driven in this business.  Our goal is to have above a 20% return on our equity.  So during the leasehold period you might be a little short of that.  But when you take into consideration the sale of the asset as well, hopefully, that gets you over the 20%.  So based on the – where we are in the cycle on that particular aircraft will determine when we will go ahead and make the sale.  Now right now we're still building the pipeline., So we expect to acquire some additional aircraft this quarter and we do have letters of intent to acquire two aircraft and today we are in the process of maybe even acquiring some more and then, at the same time, there are some assets in the portfolio that we would consider selling.  So you know, it's a fluid market and it is a little hard to model but I would expect that the business will continue to perform well.  It will continue to meet our return hurdles and we will continue to make what we consider to be attractive investments.  As we get more size, it will become a little bit more predictable because we will be able to function more on a regular basis in terms of determining, at the outset of the – our plan would be to determine at the outset of the year which assets we would like to sell that particular year.  We are not quite at that point but we are close to that., Tim, do you have a sense of that?  Maybe half and half, or maybe a little more toward the sale price?, Yes, slightly more than half would be related to the sale., The problem is, I think, from what I'm referring to, really, is a 20% return on each individual investment.  So at any point in time, you might be, when the asset's on lease, the return may be less than that 20%, and when we really achieve the 20% is upon the sale.  So at some point in time, when we get the portfolio at the right level, then, I think, the assessment you're making is correct.  I don't think we are there yet, and we are still dealing with some pre-9/11 legacy assets, if you will, one of which is the one we were able to get a reduction in the non-recourse debt and we restructured the lease with the lessee, and now that we will be putting it up for sale but we will not make a 20% return on equity on that aircraft., Well, I think that's a function, I mean net investment, because I think we have to look at it from a net investment, because we probably will be selling some assets out of JV's.  So I think what you're probably – I think, in the twenty-five million dollar range would be my guess, but net additional investment.  But that subject will change, based on opportunities either to sell or opportunities to buy.  But we are very focused on this business.  The business has other benefits to AAR, aside from just the lease revenue and the sale income from the assets.  We also have two aircraft, for instance, today, that we own that are in our Indianapolis facility undergoing maintenance.  The first two aircraft that went through the Indianapolis facility came out of one our joint venture investments.  So having the aircraft activity a) obviously needs to support its own-generate its own results; but b) because of the nature of our business, it does have ancillary benefits to other aspects of AAR.  So it's an important business, but at the same time, it's a little bit hard to forecast. We have a plan in terms of what we'd like to achieve, but that can be changed, based on opportunities either, as I indicated, to buy or to sell., Yes., Thank you., In fiscal year '06 we made two very large investments in inventory to support ten-year supply chain contracts, and the investments were what really drove the negative cash flow from operations, the investments in these large inventory management programs., But we also made investments, advantageous investments in inventory to support our arbitrage business, and I think, some of that you're starting to see flow through in this year's first quarter, and, hopefully, as this year unfolds,  you'll see more of that kind of flow through, and we're getting very good returns on assets that we've bought, actually, since 9/11, actually.  So we continue, I think, to make really good investments.  This year it's hard to predict, based on program activity that we might encounter.  We have one particular program, for instance, that we know will have, will require a significant investment in inventory.  But I might add that the inventories that we bought last year to support the program, I recognize these programs are only a year in duration so far but we are achieving our targets and hurdles that we established at the time of the inventory purchases., You're talking about from the '05?  The '05 – the orders we announced in '05 have been filled., Right.  Now if you notice today we announced an order of mobility products largely – basically that was a pallet contract so that's a replenishment to that contract., Actually early next fiscal year., No, no, no.  The airplane is manufactured by Airbus., Yes, our shipments will be beginning the first quarter, hopefully, the first quarter of next year.  And next year, for us, we're on a, as you know, a May 31 fiscal year, so by summer next year we should start deliveries., That could get pushed back by Airbus, but at this point in time that's what we're expecting., I think it will take a while to build up. So far, I believe, Airbus has 200 aircraft sold – give or take a few.  We believe, based on our assessment of that aircraft, that that aircraft will be a very successful aircraft.  It has characteristics, I think, that makes it a strong competitor to the C-130 , and it's new technology, obviously, new engines.  Our cargo system we think is a very robust system.  We think that they have a chance to significantly exceed that 200 and, obviously, the more systems they put out the better it is for us., Sure., Thank you., Tim, you want to take a shot at that?  I think you've got Mark at your side. Maybe he can help you with that., Sure.  I'll go into the last part of the question first.  In terms of the charges, we will be having some costs associated with the relocation and severance.  We'll be expensing those as we incur them.  We also, though, have, offsetting those costs, grants, and offsetting the benefits from the state and county municipalities.  So at this point, at least, we're not expecting a significant impact to the P&L related to the costs associated with the relocation.  In terms of the opportunity of going forward, we think it's a place where we can attract high quality labor at attractive prices.  We think that the – we needed additional space and manufacturing capacity, and this particular location seemed to fit the bill.  So we think that, not only on the 400M, but for all of our cargo systems production, that this new facility will provide significant efficiencies for us going forward., Yes, it will., Yes.  We'll have more employees there.  The A400M contract is a significant production for us and will require additional work force., Well, in China, we have a sales office in Shanghai and we have an operation in Zhuhai where we support a specific customer.  The general tone is very positive.  Actually, throughout that region the tone is very positive.  So I think we should expect to see the company to continue to perform well in that region., Not really, I mean most of it, keep in mind right now, Malaysia is still more of a front, if you will, for our Miami operation.  When I say that is that they bring gear in, they do some light, they do some disassembly, but then they send most of the major components to Miami for repair and then they come back and reassemble in Malaysia.  So having a presence there, I think, has been a positive.  We hope, over the next year or so, we'll continue to develop capability there so that we'll be doing more things in country, but most of the growth has basically been coming out of the core operation in Miami., Not versus cargo systems, but versus some other products that we have in that sector., So, I mean what we're experiencing now is we're experiencing a lot of the smaller opportunities.  I think to your point, there are some interesting larger situations where we're in discussions.  So yes, it's kind of a blend of both, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were some large situations that happened as well., Yes, we really have no debt due this fiscal year other than maybe some minor IRB debt, but we have – we obviously are in the market trying to buy our debt when we can on advantageous terms.  As you can see, we have a fair amount of cash, cash that's invested is, you know, it's invested more than we had – at a higher rate than we had anticipated when we first started investing, but nevertheless, obviously that's not why we have the money in.  One use of funds is to pay down debts, so as opportunities come, present themselves to buy our debt we will.  We don't – we do not have, Stan, any significant debt due until December of '07, and that's a public piece so from time to time we are in the market buying that debt. Last year, Tim, what? We bought 7 million of that debt?, Right., 7.2 or something? And this year to date I think you've brought in 3 or so?, Right.  That's correct., So from time to time we will pay down debt., Tim?, Yes, EBIT, Stan, was 20 million 437 and depreciation amortization was 8.3 million., Well as you might recall we did receive approval from the board to buy shares.  We have not actually acquired any shares since then.  But obviously, we may.  Keeping our options open in that regard at this point., Tim, you have that in front of you?, Just one second, David.  It was 1.5 million shares., You know, quite frankly, we just haven't, really – maybe we should have, but we just didn't. There's no real specific reason, no.  Can't answer that., Okay.  Thank you., The fourth customer is – needs to remain undisclosed from us. But if you were to visit the Indianapolis facility, of course you would be able to see their colors on their aircraft. It is a well-known cargo operator, operating here in North America., Yes., Our current planning cycle, which is a three-year cycle., I think Arnie, all the things that we have been talking about in today's call continue to drive revenues, look for more focused on those areas, we can get greater margins throughput and operating efficiencies. So, if you look at the move to – our cargo systems move for instance, for North Carolina, although it had negative drag, let's say on the current quarter's result, the objective there is to allow us to manage a much bigger business, the business that will be twice the size it has been historically, as a result of the A400M contract, and we will be in a much lower cost environment, and it should be added to the operating income results in a way that will move the needle., Sure., Good morning, Arment., Southwest is a major contributor to the increase lines, but not the only. So, it is a good blend of business from the customers we have signaled so far., Yes that is correct., That's a good question I'm not sure, I don't have that – those details in front of me, but probably I'm being advised , So when we look at – you are talking about the aircraft market Peter?, Yes, so we are very bullish on the aircraft market. We think there are some great opportunities out there in the market and I think we've positioned ourselves well to capture those opportunities. So, I think you'll continue to see favorable results coming out of that segment., Yes, mostly., Yes., Good morning., It was predominantly from sales activity, Christine. Not a 100%, but the majority was from our sales activity., I think for the foreseeable future., Yes., Okay. So, Oklahoma and Miami both remain very busy and are being well utilized. We still have capacity particularly in Miami. There is some capacity in Oklahoma, and we're looking to expand the Oklahoma business. The things that Oklahoma does we are expecting some expansion may be to come from outside of Oklahoma. But nevertheless we currently have adequate capacity that handles additional growth. Malaysia is really just kicking into gear so we're continuing to invest an equipment to build that shop. Right now the shop are still acting more as a storefront then as a maintenance provider, but I would say by about next year this time will be a more robust business in Malaysia., Yes, our expectations are that we AAR positions itself in that market as a major service provider for landing gear. And based on what we have seen so far that strategy seems to be working. We're tracking business from that region. We have committed to the customers that in time, we will have a fully operational maintenance business there in Malaysia. We're walking before we run. As I have indicated, I believe about a year from now we should be much more robust than we are today., I don't believe that there is any meaningful difference. As we get more work into the facility, we will become more efficient, as we gain more experience, time we've only been, we opened up for business only two years ago. So, I mean the progress we have made in a relatively short period of time, I think has been spectacular and we're still getting better every day, every month and I would anticipate that as we rise the bar in terms of – or as we increase the revenue we will continue to raise the bar in terms of our operating income expectations., What you see in part of our results to this quarter is that we have been ramping up in anticipation of the work. So, a little bit of a drag on second quarter results was due to the fact that we have been building work force to accommodate this workload and we, the management, we feel very confident that as the work comes in we will be in an excellent position from workforce vantage point numbers and effectiveness, which means the ability for the mechanics to do the work. We feel will be in a very good position., Sure., Good morning., I think we prefer not. I think we prefer not to for a few reasons. One is I am , Well, I think the way to look at it is that we have an opportunity here to really build a strong business around sort of Southwest. So, as we execute against the opportunity, then I think it would be our goal to see us become a very major support arm for Southwest. We already performed landing gear maintenance for the Southwest and we perform certain component maintenance for Southwest, all of which I believe they are fairly pleased, that led them to putting aircrafts into our maintenance facility and our goal here is to perform and they are in their respect to our performance, and in the process grow our business with them., We may have seen that two or three years ago, we are not seeing that today. We are seeing a much more rational pricing environment for MRO activity. I think some of the major customers are major airlines who outsourced work they, – they started outsourcing work say two years ago. We are somewhat disappointed by some of the selections they've made. I think there is a greater focus today on quality, turn times, and performance. And pricing seems to be solidified., Sure. So, when you think of the acquisition opportunities, when you think of our growth strategy, you're looking at say let's refer to a three different segments thinking of the Aircraft Sales and Leasing acquisition strategy being more tied to specific transactions than to a business. Our supply chain business as you can see is growing at a very acceptable rate. There are certain holes that we have in our strategy that we would like to fill. We're looking for geographic growth. We're looking for more component repair capability, slight increase from P&A opportunities. So, yes, there are some opportunities within the supply chain group that we would like to sell out through the acquisition or process. If you look at MRO, we have, obviously, we have made some moves in this regard with the Indianapolis facility, not necessarily an acquisition, but we have assumed the lease of a very major structure. We will – we are certain holes in our MRO strategy relating to different category of aircraft and geography. We will continue to explore our opportunities along those lines. In the Structures and Systems business, we look at that business from three different perspectives. One is we have our mobility business, which we will look to continue to grow and look for add-on capabilities that could be acquired as opposed to build from scratch. If you look at our cargo systems business, there are certain opportunities to expand our footprint in that market. And then we look at the overall parts markets, and we would like to be a bigger player in the production of parts be more of a player on this build cycle let's say. So, there is no shortage ways for us to go ahead and expand our position, and we are exploring a few of these., I think most of the substance we would be looking would be smaller than that. There are situations that are larger, but at this moment the things that we are kind of zero in the end would be a little bit smaller, you will be look at then at more product line extensions, there was businesses that would fit into our existing management structure, there are a couple of situation out there that might be a little bit bigger, but things I think you should be counting on right now are of a smaller size., Yes, the joint ventures in this quarter, I believe added 1.1% to our operating margins. As we go forward, I think if we look at it in that range, I think that is about the right level. Keep in mind now we start talking about 10% operating margins when our operating margins where in the 5% range, and as we are approaching this 10% range we are kind raising the bar to 12.5 and you get there in a few different ways. One is sales growth, because we have shown that our margins on our incremental sales are far in excess of the 10 or even 12.5% that we're signaling. We have in the past sold off product lines or stopped doing working areas that are not productive. So, we will continue to look – continue with sharp focus to look for things that we're doing that we shouldn't be doing and also to invest in those things, where we believe the margin opportunity is greater than that 12.5, bring us up to that 12.5% level. So, between sales growth, sharp focus, operational efficiencies as demonstrated by our efforts down in this relocation from Detroit to North Carolina, that's how we get to that – get heading in that direction., Yes., Good morning., I think 10. Well, I mean, I'm sorry, eight bays in April., So, we have good visibility through July, and through July, we should be sustaining that level., Yes, that's correct., We have had discussions with the leaseholder. The leaseholder is in the airline that uses those hangars for storage. Right now, I won't be counting on that, but it is possible at some point in time., Yes, I think you are looking about $0.5 million of sales that would have taken place had we not made the relocation., 0.5 million in sales, so we can pinpoint., And then, of course, you need to be thinking in terms of management's focus on relocation as opposed to --., Not count doors , Okay., I think, approximately, $2 million on a year-over-year basis., Purely is scheduled, purely a deviation in schedule. That particular customer will see a continued decline for the next few months, and that their schedule starts speaking up for the as we get further into calendar '07., Yes, I'll give you the components. Operating properly EBIT was 23.422 million. And depreciation, amortization was 7.861 million., Our next major debt obligation comes due in December '07, and having paid down 8 million in the last 90 days we have a remaining balance of approximately 31 million. So, as bonds become available at an attractive price we will continue to pick them up between now and December and whatever is left in December will be paid off at that point., Yes., Thank you., Arnie, I think in terms of pure expense I wouldn't say it is a significant, I think between the sales impact, the disruption and the expenses it is probably in the range of a $0.01 a share, we did get some benefits from grants and the like to help us offset some of the costs that we incurred., I think, the recoveries – I think there will be some more in the third quarter, I think by the time we get to the fourth quarter we should have it all behind us., On our part supply business we have seen some improved results and as we build our presence in China we expect to see strong results. China – Asia still represents about 7% of our total sales today, you may recall that it up from 1% back in 2001. So, Asia has become a much more important market for us and our goal would be to see Asia, the 15% of sales and say towards the end of this planning cycle and that is going to be a result of having more – its presence in the region and as the region continues to mature the opportunities for our company like us become more real., Arnie, as David went through, we will go from 4 bays in December to 6 bays in January, we will give 30 days notice and we will start paying the rent once the bay becomes available to us., Well the start-up expenses are some of the things that David had alluded to or spoken about. We have incurred basically start-up expenses in the second quarter in preparation for these new customers. So, now we will start to actually get the benefit of that we've incurred to prepare for these customer., I think as the earnings increase Peter the tax rate is going to continue to increase a bit, but I think in the 32% range, maybe slightly higher., Right., I believe there will be some airline consolidation. In short-term we'd probably get somewhat affected by depending on whose the consolidator is and who the consolidatee might be and then longer term it really doesn't make a difference and in short-term here would be an immediate change as a result of an acquisition, but if you are tapping in the market – and that would be more from a historical perspective, what we are experiencing in the market today is there is a shortage of – particularly on the MRO side, there is a shortage of supply, it's mostly labor-related more so than facility-related, so, – and some of our trained labor. So, in terms of an impact on consolidation – impact on AAR I won't anticipate much., No, I really don't., I think long term would be – it's good for us and I think that will create opportunities as aircraft, let's say move from one new venture to another venture. So, if Delta and US Air were to combine for instance, it might cause certain aircraft to become available. Those aircraft would eventually become consumed elsewhere, so that would create opportunity for the company., I'm sorry Peter., We are expecting revenues to begin in fiscal 2008., As we can further down the road and Airbus firms up a little bit more in the schedule we will give more information on that., Let me first of all say that the pallet business is expectable margins, it is lower margin than some of the other things we do in the mobility area, but it's still very acceptable margins. The objective in our mobility business is to move from, let's say, being a manufacturer of product into a provider of services. So, when you start thinking about our mobility, you are going to start seeing us in broader stand , I think you're going to continue to see margin improvement come out of that segment sequentially., I think one-way to look at the business is that we have 13% growth in the period. And in the period, we signed these three contracts, one with Chautauqua, one with Southwest, and one on the pallet contract. We received zero revenue from any of those contracts in this period where we had 13% growth. The revenues from those contracts kick in here in the third – begin in the third quarter. So, as we inject these agreements, I think you'll start seeing some meaningful sales growth again., Yes, growth in commercial was 18% – 18.4, and growth in defense was 7%., Yes., We have an authorization and as the opportunities present themselves, the answer would be yes., Let me stand by my answer., Yes, Peter.  I think you're absolutely correct.  There is a seasonality to our business.  You would expect the summer months, when airplanes are flying in greater numbers, the airlines are less inclined to put aircrafts through maintenance during this period.  So, you have a little bit of strain on the numbers in the first quarter.  That also is true, to some extent, in the December period where the airplanes, where the airlines prefer to operate the airplanes that's supposed to go true way , There's some pressure but I think we're expecting the – maintain margins.  There could be some more mixed pressure but there should be some other things that offset that mixed pressure.  So my plan at least , Yes, I believe they're very pleased with the service we're providing and we continue to execute well against that plan and we think we have a model that is transportable to other customers and that's the direction we're heading., Opportunistically., We feel good about the opportunity pool and the – yes, we're in good shape., I'll ask our colorful CFO there., Arnie we have good visibility into the mobility business that the backlog there is strong.  We do see an increase in the backlog for palette and containers which is what – palettes and shelters which is what's driving this change in the margins.  But going forward we expect margins, as David said, at this level or slightly better., Yes, I believe that would be a good level to build for.  Yes, I think you're correct., Good morning., Yes, it is progressing well.  We have five-gear in shop today, so we are very pleased, still relatively small numbers but at least the competitive – it seems like we are – we still feel very good about the growth market, the aspects of the market, which tends to be towards growth and we have a good position.  We probably need to build more in-country capability.  We are still depending very heavily on our Miami operations, so a gear coming through, they get stripped, but then they get sent to Miami for the heavy operations.  We will probably – with the workload that we are now experiencing, or with the interest level that we are experiencing, we probably will have to make more in-country investments in Malaysia but right now we are very pleased., Yes, I think, yes we do.  I think for competitive purposes we prefer not to disclose that., Yes, yes., Well, you have the summer months challenges so it might be a little bit softer in the summer than we have before but – than we had say in the spring, I should say, but we feel very confident with the build-up in workload projected for that operation., Yes, our preference, Tyler is not to really comment in this context, other than give directional guidance., And we feel that we have – we are in a good position.  We feel the – in answering the comments from Arnie before, the opportunities are there, the company, we believe, is well positioned.  We have a good team in place.  We have a good track record.  There is some momentum but we prefer not to forecast, but we feel we are in a good place., Sure, sure.  Well, if you look at the supply chain and you look at MRO operations, they both are geared towards a trend towards out-sourcing by major carriers, not just in North America, but outside of North America and this would cover carriers who are operating, let's say, wide-body aircraft, narrow-body aircraft and regional aircraft so as the tendency and trend here has been to work with third-party maintenance and supply operators, such as ourselves.  We believe that the – those drivers are still in place.  As you look at the structures and systems piece of our business, a major portion of that business is tied to the deployment requirement of principally the US Armed Forces but also foreign governments as well.  We have unique products in this market and as the need to move troops or supplies to various tiers of operation continues to proliferate, our products are there to assist. So the major drivers there have been largely around the geo-political environment that we are faced with on a world-wide situation., We also manufacture cargo systems in that market for commercial applications, as well for military applications and the instructions systems group, I should say, and the drivers there are around changes in demand for freighter lift as the world demand for freight traffic increases and as the opportunity to convert commercial aircraft to freighter aircraft proliferates. We have products to fill that niche as well.  We, last year and now, a very major , Our aircraft sells and leasing business, the major drivers there are opportunistic buys, where we see, let's say, discrepancies in market values and in-balances in terms of aircraft operations where you may have more aircraft supporting the North American market places than are necessary as those aircrafts exit that market, there are opportunities to place those aircrafts in other markets.  We've felt a pretty good presence in that market as well.  So, basically those are the fundamental drivers and if you look at the results in the last couple years, at least, the demand in each one of those segments of our business have been fairly strong., It is really hard to say, because you have, in each carrier, you have a different dynamic, so it would be very difficult to pin point where we are, also keep in mind it is a world wide market.  I would say you are probably in the first third of the game., Andy, how are you?, I do.  The accounts receivable at year end was $136 million and inventory was $259 million., All right.  So we're very excited about the company's prospects in Asia.  Earlier I answered a question about the company's joint venture in Malaysia, which has gotten off to a pretty good start.  In the last couple of years, we've opened up offices in, not just Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, but we've also opened up an office in Shanghai, in China.  We've had some good progress in getting the company positioned in the market.  The result on a year-over-year basis might be relatively modest, but we – there were some specific – special situations prior year, which we benefited from.  But we expect double-digit growth coming out of that region for the company.  So, yes, we're pretty bullish.  We also happen to be doing quite well in Europe for that matter and probably benefiting from some of the outsourcing trends both in the commercial markets as well as defence markets., We expect the tax rate to be sort of in the 30% range going forward.  We are – some of the tax law changes are impacting us in fiscal '07., The CapEx we expect to be in the 20 to 25 million range for fiscal '07., The – in that number is approximately $10 million of facility expansions that really would be growth CapEx.  In addition to the range I gave you, we are still investing in non-recurring engineering on the A400M.  We expect, on top of the CapEx number I gave you, an additional approximately $13 million for A400M., That actually goes through the cash flow from operations, not – it's not in the CapEx number, but it is a commitment that we expect., I think that the – I think using the 43 to 44 million share count is the right share count to use and that the vast majority of the dilution is due to the convert., Right., I expect depreciation to be in the same $30 million range for 2007., I'll tell you what I'll do I'll give you EBIT and I'll give you depreciation and amortization.  Okay?, EBIT was $20 million 283., Right, and depreciation was 7.6 million., Yes, depreciation should be that 30 million number., Yes., Yes., Yes., It's a little bit of everything Peter.  It's a little bit of Oklahoma.  It's a little bit of Landing Gear , Right., Yes, yes., Okay., Fiscal '06?  You mean fiscal '06?, Well, probably in the $30 million range, $35 to 40 million range for the year that just ended., I don't think we have that information right in front of us here.  I'm mean obviously we have a detailed assessment of that as it relates to a break up between new programs and continuing to fund existing programs but you know that's going to be really tags , I also – I don't have that information right now.  But if you call Tim back, he – I'm sure he can – he has something along those lines., Okay., We didn't buy any of the converts back in Q4.  And we expect to continue to invest our cash that we have on hand and our cash that we generate into growing the business."
1004,2007.0,Q&A,a,"Good morning., We're less than 5, okay, but we're getting better at a very quick pace here particularly at Indianapolis. We've got -- the customers like what we're doing and we're delivering quality, good-quality aircraft on time, so that was our first -- if you remember – that was our first challenge was to go ahead and get customer acceptance, and we have that. We've got, you know the place is busy, we've been able to go ahead and build up a good workforce, we have an excellent leadership team in place, we've got some stability there. Now, it's a matter of improving the profitability. And we're doing that by going ahead and implementing some lean initiatives across the operation. We are looking at some of the contracts that we have and making some changes that are going to go ahead and make a difference for us, near-term, and we're starting to see the results. Most of our August results were actually pretty strong, both from a top line and from a margin perspective, so that – we're encouraged by what we are seeing. We think that the improvements are real and sustainable. And we think we're very, very close here to turning the corner. And as David said, we have a very low capital base here, so if we can go ahead and get the margin where we want it, we're going to have a phenomenal return on capital. So I, we're below five, and we're headed to 10., I don't know that's a four. How about 4?, We're night and day better than where we were., I mean, I don't really --, The pace has accelerated, okay. The pace of our progress has accelerated., Yes., We need a few things to happen. There is parts of the business outside of the heavy maintenance that go ahead and can help contribute to the margin, so, we'll have to develop for, but it certainly is our plan., No, no. It's about trying to get paid for more of the hours that we're expending on the aircraft., We're trying to recover more hours, Well, that's happening -- that's happening., I think that the pace of progress there is -- that's a little slower than the kind of curb around it at Indianapolis, but it's a area of extreme focus and these jobs. And we've got people in there that are driving the business to get better results, better operating margins, better return on capital those types of things., That's probably similar -- similar., You changed the scale on me., Let's say, we're at a 4 now. By the end of the year, we should be a lot closer to a 10, but maybe not all the way there., We are., No, not really., Due to two separate situations. But they weren't necessarily both at Indianapolis., The contract negotiation is with a customer in Indianapolis, and the aircraft that were – let's call challenging to redeliver were in our Oklahoma facility., Yes., A small acquisition, Peter. We were expecting the business-we were expecting by this point in time that we would have much -- a better margin environment in that business, but in reality we had to put some discipline in some places that we thought that we kind of were surprised about let's say. And when we did a much more thorough review of post acquisitions, we recognized we had to beef up some of the quality control and operating procedures, and we're really just in the midst of doing that this moment., I think it's an ongoing process, and I think we'll start getting back some margins that we're expecting say in the fourth quarter. But again, this was relatively small acquisitions., Small numbers. Not really that moving needle kind of things, but nevertheless something worth paying attention to. We still feel good about the regional airline space. It's important part of our supply chain business and should become increasingly important part of our MRO universe. So, yeah, we have good people there looking at the right thing., So, it's a, of course a worldwide business for the company. The large acquisition we refer to was coming out of the Asian theater. The demand for aircraft still feels relatively robust. I think we have got since we made it prudent. Their leases are in place for a -- in the case of a large buy, three to five years. In the case of 747 they're leasing to the middle teens. I think we're making good value buys. And, yeah, I think the margins robust as I've seen. If you look at the quarter's results, quarter's results were very strong, and we anticipate that environment will continue. The less requirement is still out there. As you see the OEs, of course, they've a huge order book backlogs and order books, and maybe struggling a little bit with some of the newer technology stuff. But, the demand for -- these are all Phase III aircraft we're acquiring and in the case of the Malaysian aircraft the middle 90's aircraft. So these aircraft in our view at least another life or two ahead of them. So yeah, we feel good about that business. We are making -- we are in good position. We continue to do these deals on a leverage basis with the debt on a non-recourse basis. We continue to track partners to share the burden, but also of course share the opportunity. We've received fees from our partners for managing the assets, I think we're in a good position. It is a little confusing, I recognize it a little confusing how we account for the activity because some of the activity is -- are assets that we have on our own account and some of the assets are in joint ventures. Most of the assets we're acquiring today are in joint ventures, however in theory, we defended, we acquired a couple of assets and slipped them in the same time period and those came through our wholly owned, above-the-line features. So, yes, to answer to your question the business feels robust, feels strong, like I said, it's international in scope. So although there might be potential credit tightening here in North America elsewhere we're just not seeing that, we're just seeing demand for lift., As long as we keep flipping the assets, we obviously keep moving the assets through, I feel comfortable expanding the fleet. As the time comes when it gets a little tougher to go ahead and move assets out, then I think we'll slowdown, but I think it is -- I hope that we will be able to anticipate that. But right now, the markets feels good and I think we're selectively looking to increase the fleet, we didn't necessarily expect the fleet to be at this size at this point in time, but we took advantage of what we think is a wonderful opportunity. We're in essence controlling a $187 million of assets with an $18 million investment making a fairly good return with some pretty good upside. So I think we will continue to look for deals of that nature., 41, 40., 31 through joint ventures and 9 through our -- in our own account., 
            , Thanks., Yes, absolutely., Okay. So let me answer the container contract item first, because that's really the -- and that is yes, margins will improve with container mix -- in the mix. To your first question, it is a combination of a little bit of mix and also challenges our cargo systems business. So we made this move if you will and it is -- we anticipated that the move would be completed. We continue to operate at our two facilities, both in Detroit, so that we have the reminiscence of the operation up there and we are still slowly transitioning down to North Carolina. There were some issues around that FAA certification that took us a little longer than we expected. So gradually, that work will move totally down to North Carolina, at which point in time we'll see a little bit more, better margin footprint. So two things, mix to a small degree and cargo systems to a larger degree., I think we are looking in the less than 30, less than 38, some time this quarter. So let's say, it takes a little longer, so some time before November, let's say, before November, before this period is out, this should be complete in the second quarter., But obviously, the fleet size has increased, so our base has increased. We have a very attractive return on our large purchase that we made. So we have a nice quarterly run rate let's say that has -- a level let's say twice what the run rate would have been a year ago at this time, maybe even slightly better. And then we are looking to opportunistically dispose off assets through those joint ventures. Now we probably won't be disposing of any of these 73s that we just bought for a period. We're enjoying good returns, and I don't think we want to go ahead necessarily and cycle out of that at this point. But we will be cycling out of those aircraft over the next, three to five years. So hopefully by the end of lease, we may have some remaining that we put on lease without the parties, but hopefully we will cycle through it. And that the income from those trades would come through the joint-venture line. And as we acquire other assets like 747-400 in joint venture the income, the monthly quarterly income -- the lease income will come through that line and then sometime -- if the right opportunity presents itself for that asset, we would look to trade that as well. So, I think the base line income for that line will be improving and then I think you'll see some kind of time there will be trades that will make that number even more attractive, more appealing., I think -- eight days, nine line, eight days, nine line., Yes. Okay. So job number one, we have the work that we – we're happy with the work that we have right now, we gotta get the margin right. And as Tim alluded -- as Tim mentioned in his comments to Peter, there is a contract negotiation with one of our customers there that should improve, help us improve operations -- results of that operation. I think -- if we get a good 90-day period under our belt, then I think we can look to bring in more business. We do have some demand for additional business and that's what's giving us a little bit more courage, if you will, in terms of how we're looking at the future prospects for that business., Let's get back to you on that. Let's just kind of digest all of the stuff that is going on here, but it's still for us -- it's still, let's call a very near term goal. I don't want to say it's going to be here tomorrow. Let us get back to you on that, okay?, Right. Thank you., We are going through the negotiation process. So it's, yes, we are going through the process., Very shortly., It's not insignificant for that business, so it's a needle mover for the business. When you're looking the entire corporation. It'll move margins in the right direction., Yes., It's basically a piece of the contract relating to the hours that we're spending on the piece of the contract and that's a major piece of negotiation., We had a couple of airplanes from one customer that cycled through our Oklahoma facility during summer, which required slightly different kind of maintenance than we've had in the past with that customer and we stack up through those airplanes. So those airplanes, basically we will not see those -- that situation develop again there in our Oklahoma operation., Correct., Different kind of maintenance, not new work, different maintenance requirements for similar aircraft than what we've got before., If it comes to us again, it'll be more profitable for us., Not much, it's a question of just spending money, it's a question of getting the right procedures in place, be consistent with the other MRO operations that we have at the company. We pride ourselves in our relationships with at the FAA and our relationships with our customers. That's the job number one. Obviously the safety of planes. And we just had to put a little more about discipline into the operation than we anticipated, few more procedures. We had to transfer people from our Oklahoma operations, to keep a closer eye and we're in the process of getting that right. It's a relatively small operation so I don't want to put overweighting on this. But we are, AAR-izing the business if you will., We have a very robust bid list we've had for a while, taken a little longer to, let's say, bring these to closure than we'd like to see, but we are working on some exciting programs as we speak. Keep in mind here, we have a worldwide leadership position in this market and there is a fair amount of demand and our people are starting through that demand, and hopefully we can bring another deal or so to closure within this fiscal year of meaningful magnitude., The fact, the DoD business for our logistics business is strong. There is a backlog of opportunities that guys – that folks are working on there, more on the -- we're very focused around what's going on in Huntsville. So Army activity is very important to the company, so we continue to try to expand that activity., Hi, Christine., No, Christine. It should be higher than that. The transactions that we talked about here just closed really in the middle of the quarter, so, you'll see that come up., We are expecting a sale out of our joint venture packet., Christine, let me just restate that the -- sale that we're looking to make is actually on our books, so it would be above-the-line transaction., No, pricing is not the issue. So, pricing is relatively strong. We entered into an agreement, at that time we were looking to bring in some business into our Indianapolis facility. We were aggressive and the other side I think was aggressive as well. And I think they recognized that the work they are receiving is, they're pleased with, and I think we've shared with them data, sufficient enough data that brings them to the point that they recognize that we need to be paid for more hours that we put into the aircraft. So, the rates are good, rates are strong, no softness in that regard., I think there will constantly be pressure on the labor side. We're still working with contract laborers for instance, we prefer to have more heavier weighting of our own mechanics but part of that is a cost sensitive solution, and yeah, I think there is some pressure on the cost side there., Yes., Hard to measure precisely, but I would say that there is a piece -- I think you kind of nailed it. I think a piece of it is kind of recurring if you will and a piece of it would be slightly would be incremental., The bulk of it would be recurring., By doing it this way, it's in a contracting vehicle that makes it easier for our customers to acquire the product. So, we think by doing it this way, we'll have a better chance of selling more of these items., Jon, actually what I said is that we believe there was a million of non-recurring expenses in the quarter. Some of it was severance related and some of it was related to what we say -, Seasonal expenses., Seasonal expenses., Yes some will., I think we feel good about the contracts that we have Jon., We're looking at some things. We have one situation that's in our scope, let's say, that is progressing nicely. It will add to our Structures & Systems capability. A little bit more commercial bent than defense bent, but also with some defense activity as well. So that one is moving along nicely and so we're continuing to look at properties that are available to us here., It's scheduled to ship towards the end of fiscal '08., The Boeing is a different aircraft. That's a 787., Larry, it looks good. There is the -- the supply chain segment has opportunities related across the globe. There is a lot going on Europe, there is a lot going on in Asia and there is lot going on in North America., In terms of the quarter we had a increase in activity in Asia, I think Europe about the same. But in terms of prospects I think it's -- as David said it's robust and it's robust around the globe., Yes., I think it's not that --., We talked about the Southwest line, Larry., So, that's the --., Yes. It's not a new customer, but there's a new line from a current customer that starting to fall and that what translated to the one incremental line for the business fall in., Yes., Well Chip, I think, the map for 2006 on Aviation Supply Chain is not right. You may have added back entire impairment charges that the company took first quarter last year. Only a portion of that was supply chain related the other portion was related to our aircraft business. So, if you -- if you do a pro forma calculation which -- which we did for you. If you did a pro forma calculation you'd find that the Aviation Supply Chain for a profit last year was 21.2 and all that is the actual reported gross profit plus an add back of $4.8 million., Yes. I mean, if you want to do it offline, I can work you to the math more specifically but the short answer is even if you pro forma adjust to the impairment in that segment, the segment increased 120 basis point year-over-year., Yes. That is correct, and really that's the impact or that's driven by what you've heard so far today about – we've had some trouble with aircraft with two different customers, one is contract related and --, For that the other is just -- we don't think that will be with us for a long time., We don't have it precise, but yes we think it's definitely the main driver., Yes, every word., And Eric, one thing you have keep in mind when you go back a year ago, we did have some more container activity, which as you know was some of our higher margin activity in the mobility business. So, you had a few different moving pieces other than cargo systems. But I think the short answer to your question is yes., Yes, you'll see them in the balance sheet, but I think David's alluded to it here, Eric. I mean the major acquisition was the large portfolio related to Malaysia Airlines, the 18 aircraft and as he told you earlier, 180 -- almost 190 million of asset value and our investment was about $18 million there., Yes., They are, yes., Well, we have – we're doing okay. We'd like to be doing better. We have a variety of hiring programs going on. We're partnering with the local aviation university that we believe is going to be a great source of -- great source of talent for us. We're partnering with the local community colleges. So, I think it's a little tight, as we've said, but we're still able to go ahead and bring in people. I think we are working through it., It's an industry-wide situation and somewhat is related to specific skills. So we are -- in addition to going through outside sources, we are also having internal training programs for our own people who want to go ahead and learn some of the specialties that are in such high demand., Well, okay. So, we are occupying eight hangars as we've said earlier. And we have access to ten. So, that's part of the story. There is other business that's ancillary to doing the heavy maintenance like line services and like engineering services, which we have a tremendous amount of capacity for growth there. As it relates quickly to hangar safe, we've got some capacity. As it relates to the other services that we can provide, there is -- there is plenty of runway for us to expand., I think that -- I think that we are still out there looking for work. We have capacity to take on additional work. We are not the end -- we are not at the end of our work capacity and frankly, there is other ways for us to go and get capacity in the market at the right time if we need it., Yes. And as we talked about at the end of our fourth quarter, we thought -- we think our effective tax rate will be between 34 and 35% for the year., Well, this quarter you'll see we are at 34%. We'll continue to refine that as necessary as we get deeper into the year., We might be -- we are still truing up some of the purchase accounting issues related to our acquisitions. And that will have an impact on what the amortization we have for intangible assets. So, I think we are still working through that a little bit. It'd probably be slightly higher than what you said., There may be. There may be., Just being reviewed at this point time in time, not really sure, Stan. But as I said, may be., Yes., Yes., Thank you., Good morning, Eric, what I indicated was that for the first time in recent memory for me at least in my business career, which spans 29 years in aviation, historically, there was a – more of a drive for US folks – US operators to send aircraft either into Asia or to Europe. If I go back in time more so in Europe, more so today in Asia, but that with the weakening dollar what we were starting to see, which was starting to kick in say in the last 30 days prior to that when I made that speech, was that we're starting to see folks from Europe express interest in putting aircraft into North America because of the high – the exchange rate the way it is. So, right now it's – interest is being expressed and I believe that there will be some opportunities in that regard as the – if the US currency continues to stay as weak as it is., Loaded question. Use your imagination., Maybe, Eric, just I would talk about it just in the context of total MRO., Other than specific operations, and I'd say that we've made significant progress. We talked about it on the last call. We felt like we were headed in the right direction then – and we achieved the results that we were expecting. Having said that though, I continue to think that there is opportunity, there is opportunity to work closely with our customers to reduce the span time. We've got process improvement initiative going on across each of our MRO facilities. So, even though we've made significant progress, I think there is – there continues to be opportunity to get better. On the component businesses, I think we are not as far along there as we needed to be. We are active in terms of the initiative there, both strategic and process, and we're going to continue to attack that until we get the results that we are looking for., We've talked about margin in this business before. You have – by the nature of the business, you have volatility in the margins there. As the component businesses improve, it's going to have a positive impact on margins, but I think you really have to expect some volatility in the margins in that segment within a range., Yes, Troy, obviously we're proud of achieving the 10%, it took us maybe a little longer than we had hoped. Hopefully, we can sustain that 10% going forward and start seeing some improvement. What I had indicated is, we've kind of raised the bar, because we had felt going back around six months ago that we had – that the 10% was clearly in sight and yet we were not satisfied with only being at 10%. So I think it's still in our planning cycle, planning cycle is a three-year cycle. We started signaling this about six months ago. So we are holding to that timeframe to start seeing some improvement., Sales growth. I think you just said it, leveraging off our SG&A base, improving some of our underperforming businesses and getting income off of our leasing business as you indicated. So I think you pretty much nailed it., Yes, I believe all contribute, probably the leasing probably the least, so you're probably getting more off of getting your underperforming businesses to improve while at the same time continue to drive sales growth. I mean if we continue to get the kind of organic growth that we're getting, we should start seeing margin as Tim starts making some progress on his operating margin – his initiatives. You know, because we're investing a fair amount right now in driving lean through our businesses and hopefully we start seeing the benefits which I think you're starting to see, but hopefully we start to see more of those benefits as we move along towards let's say that 2.5 year time period., I think that's a major driver and hopefully we continue to get margins out of our aircraft leasing business., I don't – think that's a little bit probably more aggressive than we're forecasting. You know us well enough to know we watched our costs really closely, but if we do a little better than the 10%, I think that would be really good and I think getting down to 9% probably is not in the cards at least for the foreseeable future., Hi, Troy, this is Rick. I mean we've also decided as we have discussed a little bit in the past, we decided to invest to drive that top line gross margin performance as well. So there is a relationship between investing in infrastructure and investing in process improvement to drive out some of that margin you're seeing at the gross margin level. And we think that's a good trade-off., 
            , So I guess in order of your questions, I mean from a top line perspective, we would expect this in the near term to contribute about 25 million per quarter, the top line add. On a margin basis, for the Structures and Systems segment that it reports to, we still have to sort out some of the purchase accounting effects, but our expectation would be, it would be about – it would not be accretive or dilutive to the segment margin, probably right now. But we still have to sort out purchase accounting there. And I think in terms of integration, we see this as an easier integration effort, because it really is a – it's a launching pad for us into some more parts manufacturing and the level of integration will be modest early on. We'll look to get some good synergies across some of our other businesses as time goes by, but we don't have the same level of integration needs that we did with say , You'll see top line growth from both Summa as well as organic. That's right., Hi, Tyler. So we still have opportunity to grow in Indianapolis. There is a few different ways to expand. One, there is a hangar space available for us there that we're not currently utilizing. We expect to go out and fill that out. I've mentioned before other growth initiatives that we have in our MRO business, including line maintenance, engineering services that don't consume hangar capacity. And then we've got some other ideas to further expand there. So we still have some opportunity for growth there., We have it, I mean, we've tried to – it moves around a lot now that you have the activity that we have there, so it changes on a weekly basis but we are between – any given day we are between 7 and 9 days being utilized., Pipeline is strong., 21%., Well, in terms of what their willingness is, let's put it this way, there is a fair amount of interest in doing program – in various different programs coming out of different parts of the world actually at this moment. So we – our pipeline is strong and we should be able, if not in the next quarter than in the quarter beyond that. This quarter will be – the growth will be fueled largely by many of the investments that we made in the second quarter but the – notwithstanding that, we should also have some success between now and the end of the year, at least fiscal year, on one or more of these programs that are in the pipeline. I don't see any difference in willingness than I have before. I think it is just a question of dotting a lot of 'i's, crossing a lot of 't's, and gestation period if you will of some of these situations., Okay., Good morning., So the Indianapolis business has, as you recall, is a relatively young business for us., And it's been improving nicely. We had a few different things to take care of, some customer contracts. But the most important thing I think is that the team there is working very well with its customers. The processes are getting better, by the day more efficient. So I think it's a combination of the things that we talked about related to specific contracts and just overall improvement in the way we're executing that business., We're going to continue to drive for top line growth and earnings efficiency in that segment., Well I think there were gains and they contributed to the earnings improvement that you've seen out of that segment., We prefer not to., Yes. Okay., We are okay with the pricing environment and the labor environment, while a little tight, we've been able to go ahead and get the people that we've needed. So I think in both cases, we're okay. I think we could use a few more people with certain specific skill sets, but we're managing through it., Yes, it hasn't changed materially from where were at year-end. You're still – about 35% of our revenues are coming outside the US., Say it one more time?, Yes, we are., Not really., You're seeing consistent growth and consistent performance by that group. I mean, in answer to last question in terms of what the profitability was on a transaction, obviously that causes lots of problems in the business, so that would be communicating what kind of gain you had on a transaction. But suffice it to say that the fleet size is at a level now which affords us the opportunity to manage the business a little bit differently than we have in the past. So you should be expecting, notwithstanding from time to time a fluctuation or two, you should be expecting consistent steady earnings performance from that business., We haven't seen them yet., Yes., Evan, let me clarify, it's not 35%, it's 25%., On the International question., Stan, we continue to look, so we – what's important to us is obviously we want – we're trying to build a great company here and in the process of doing acquisitions, we've now done – we've completed three in the last year. We've had some success on one acquisition, we expect the second – the latest acquisition to be successful in terms of integration. First acquisition in terms – in the MRO space didn't quite meet our expectations. We recognize we have certain challenges around it, but I think the key element for us is to see how we do in integrating the current acquisitions and that will be a marker for the speed in which we accelerate further acquisitions. So there is a pipeline, there are opportunities out there for the company, but I think we're going to walk before we run. Now having said all that, if a situation develops that looks right for us, we will move accordingly., Well, we are aware that that business is for sale. As it relates to AAR, I prefer not to comment., Yes, the second quarter is about $9.8 million., It's not a recognized GAAP measure and we prefer to just keep the reporting the way we have it structured right now., I'm sorry?, With the press release?, I mean you'll get – obviously you'll get it with the 10-Q., Let us think about that., Thank you., Well, I think first of all you still have – you see growth – , And I think you will also – as we continue to improve our component businesses and the contribution that they make to the overall segment, I think that will also help our growth rate there., I wouldn't be alarmed, let me put it that way, and Rick might want to add something., Troy, I mean, the short – I think the short answer to your questions is in terms of why is, one, we've already annualized all the significant supply chain programs that we've put in place, so timing of new programs didn't give us any lift in terms of year-over-year. And then secondly, we really focused on margin generation and I think we're very focused on high-quality sales for the quarter. So we'll continue to drive high quality numbers, but I think as our program pipeline continues to mature, that's where you get the double benefit of lift on the top line., I think I'd say it differently is if we didn't care about our margins, we clearly could have stuffed more stuff through the pipeline., We are., We're – we've added lines with certain customers and we continue to talk to other customers about more work., You just experienced 64% growth, – 64% growth in that segment. So obviously we're making headway with our customers., Yes., Yes., We don't expect any big charges. Obviously, it's not in our numbers now, from a revenue or an earnings prospective. We're hoping that they will be ready to accept delivery of cargo systems in calendar '08, but we don't know for sure., The impact basically is that the revenue is not going to hit us at the time we expected it to. So the revenue is going to hit us outside of what we originally maybe communicated or projected. And that's a function of Airbus's delays as you indicated. But I think in the terms of, as Tim was saying, there is no impact today, there are no revenues coming in from that program. So it's just a delay and instead of getting accelerating sales growth, it's just going to take a little longer to get there. It's obviously a significant program to our one specific business and then it has an impact on that group's results, but when you bring it up to consolidated level, it's fairly minor., We're not expecting that., It was just general investments. We bought actually some airplanes to disassemble into parts., That's primary., We have one needle mover, to use your phrase, and then we have fewer that are complementary and aren't necessarily what you would call needle movers., It's incremental business for us, Eric., So, yes., Yes., Right., Yeah, I mean it's D&A., Larry, so you do have some amortization from some of the intangibles we had to create on purchase accounting on these acquisitions as well. But, I think – what was your – the number question that you asked?, Right., No, I think that's a pretty good number. I think that's a good number for what we have now. It is a function of what do we sell out of some of our own aircraft portfolio., And obviously, we've just completed this new acquisition with Summa and that will change that number as well. But I think where we are at right now is the right baseline for going forward., I think the general split between the sub-regions outside of North America are about the same., So nothing has really changed there this year., Sure, Arnie. Aviation Supply Chain had gross profit of $32.4 million, the MRO segment had gross profit of 9.3 million, Structures and Systems gross profit of 10.9 million, and Aircraft Sales and Leasing had a gross profit 3 million., Yeah. Brown contributed approximately $12 million of sales., Yeah. Since we bought in them in the early April, so yeah, of the quarter., Arnie, this is Tim. How are you?, The labor situation is manageable. It's not a significant impediment for us right now. As I've talked to you about and others, our focus here at Indianapolis is improving the profitability and we've got a series of initiatives in place. As you know, we've got a wonderful facility, we've got a great customer base, we've got good utilization of the plant and it's still a very young business. It's coming up the learning curve and we're very optimistic about our prospects of improving the profitability here over time., No, no, Reebaire is a regional maintenance center and Indianapolis is a narrow-body, so no., It's relatively minor, there is some duplicate cost there but we're also -- in addition to doing the cargo systems manufacturing down there, we're also doing -- satisfying some of the excess workload that we have for mobility products and building that down there. So, yes, there is some relatively minor duplicative cost but on balance, it has been a great capacity addition to the company., Well we are comfortable with it. The drivers are number one I would say, continuing to leverage our relatively fixed cost structure which we have been able to do. I think in the fourth quarter, the incremental operating margins were 12 or 12.5%, something like that. We also are looking for improved operating margin contribution from a few of our businesses. So I think the combination of leveraging our cost structure with our sales growth and operating improvement across a couple businesses that are under contributing now as well as some of our margin enhancement initiatives through lean processes, our strategic sourcing initiative, should all contribute to improved margins., Yes, I think we would stick with our mid-teens revenue growth., Well, I think that there is a possibility of more work from Southwest and from others., We are -- and we are also doing other work for Southwest outside of Indianapolis, we are doing landing gear work as well as component repair., No, we -- as you can see, we have had good performance coming out of that group and that performance is -- we cover both defense and commercial markets and we anticipate that those markets will continue to stay strong for the company. The company as -- as you know the company has a worldwide leadership position in this market and we expect that the trends will continue to look favorable and our position is a strong position. So we anticipate that this business will continue to perform well., We have a great team in place, good momentum, good backlog, good customer coverage and no reason why that shouldn't continue., We don't really break that down but from time to time we are going ahead and selling an airplane or two. I think in this period we may have sold one. I don't recall exactly but we have -- we have a blend between the two. Clearly with the investments we have signaled here that we have made here post quarter close, there will be more income coming from lease revenue than we have had historically. The fleet size for the first time is north of 40 aircrafts and we anticipate that the revenue from leases will be meaningful as we -- as we will also continue to look to trade out of the asset from time to time as well., Yes., Well, I think in the quarter you had 14% sales growth, so it's lower than 15%. I understand that, but it is still the middle double-digit range, and I think as the obviously the basis continues to grow, it is the first time this business had revenues in excess of $500 million, I think for the year 543 if I remember correctly. And I think that we will continue to see mid double-digit sales growth. As Tim signaled for the whole corporation that is kind of our target and of course this represents 50% of our total volumes today. So, I would be -- I would be thinking that it will continue to go in that fashion., Yes and I think also the base. So, obviously when sales are growing at 20%, you had a lower base, but I think that this -- there is the quality of the earnings out of this business are exceptional and I think attaining the double-digit earnings growth is at least a very strong contribution to our operating income growth as well. So we are not experiencing unusually strong growth as we might be in other aspects of the Company, but in other aspects of the Company, we are not achieving the same margins because we are dealing, tackling the exceptional growth. So I'm very pleased with the mid double-digit growth for that business and to continue to sustain the operating margin throughput that we have been experiencing. So, yes, I -- we -- I feel good about the business. I feel good about the growth rate, the returns, all in all it is obviously it's a very solid part of our total business mix., There was. There was one aircraft sold, a 737 400., So it had good operating margin contribution. It would have been a drag on the growth margins because it was basically a flip. We bought the airplane and within a day we sold it and made a nice spread. But from a gross margin standpoint, it would have been below our standard. From an operating margin standpoint, it would have been above. So it was again a double-digit operating margin transaction., Absolutely. I think you should see some meaningful growth coming out of that business. Again, I think we have a great position. There is a lot of action going on in the world market. I think having visibility in the Asian market through our Aviation Supply Chain group and our positioning in Shanghai and Malaysia and Singapore and Tokyo, et cetera, I think is giving us a deal flow that we are able to respond to and take advantage of the market dynamics and our experience in this area, and we anticipate that this will continue to be a meaningful contributor to our overall results., Sales line, they were right around $3 million., We can hear you., That is new and additional. Eric, as you know, you do have some lines coming in and going out but it is an additional line for -- for from Southwest. It will come in later this month and then we are expecting another line from another customer to come in in the fall., Eight or nine., But again Eric, I will just say it one more time, our focus really is on improving the profitability of Indianapolis., Yes, so Eric we feel good about the progress we're making particularly on the customer front and on the performance front and we are confident that we're going to be able to get there on the margin and profitability front. Just keep in mind that we have basically less than $1 million invested in this business from a kind of a fixed asset perspective and we have about $10 million of working capital invested. So it has tremendous potential for us and we are spending a lot of time and energy trying to get it right. We think we have it right from a lot of different perspectives and we have some more work to do here on the margin side, but we are going to get there., It's pretty much behind us. It is pretty much behind us. We're as I said earlier in response to one of the other questions; we are doing more and more sheltered manufacturing down there to take on some of the new business that we have been winning there. But the cargo systems is pretty much behind us., Eric, I mean, I think, let's start with the easy part. The CapEx that will go into your free cash flow as I think we have talked in the past, we had about $30 million of CapEx in '07 and we will expect that to decrease in '08. So right now we think we will be more around $25-ish million of CapEx. In terms of operating cash flow, as you know, we are investing in the business significantly. We talked about it in the release and you hear about it in some of the other commentary going on around it. So all of those investments show up in the operating cash flow as you will see it when we file our K. We are projecting that we are going to do better on our working capital requirements, but we will continue to invest in the business. So I am not sure we are ready to give the full-year guidance on cash flow for '08 right now., I would expect positive free cash flow with the caveat that as we see opportunities to continue to invest in the business. We see lots of growth in front of us as we invest in the business, we'll make those investments., Eric, this is David. The way I view it is that by increasing the size of the portfolio, we're reducing the volatility and making a little bit more predictable giving us a broader base in which to manage the not just obviously the income from the leasing, but also the select assets on a more timing -- being able to time let's say the sale of assets to give us a more predictable income stream. So, yes, we believe we've made a very -- a couple of very good investments here. One in particular where although we've indicated 21 aircraft, we are buying 18 from one source and we believe we bought those aircraft very advantageously and we think we'll get an acceptable above target return, if you will, on those assets. So, yes, I think you can look at this business as that we stepped up a little bit here and we stepped it up because we're in the right place at the right time and I think we will as a result of this decrease the volatility., Okay. So, obviously, let's have the dust settle a little bit here. But at the same token, I believe that you should expect improving and increasing earnings coming out of that segment of our business., Let's -- let the dust settle little bit, but I think directionally you are heading in the -- you're going in the right directions., Thank you., Let me say that we are maintaining a very solid discipline around this business. Our -- for the most part, the larger transactions we are doing in joint venture, with joint venture structures, with also very disciplined partners. So I view that the visibility that this company has as a result of all the other activity we performed is unique and I think it gives us a leg up, let's say on some of the other folks who are kind of playing in this market. I think having the capital availability that we have through us either through our own capital resources or through some of our partners resources, I think would signal that we should expect us to continue to stake out our position in this market and continue to see some favorable activity in this market., So the typical term on a lease that we are buying is, now let's say between three and seven years., And it's unusual for us to go to lease term, to hold the assets through a lease term., John is a great guy. We brought John in from -- he had an airline experience, we brought him in from ATA in Indianapolis, an Indianapolis-based individual. He joined the company with broader responsibilities or different responsibilities I should say more of a staff function. We put him into the business there in Indianapolis, I think he did a nice job, I think he is a quality individual, a good guy. He moved on back into the airline business, which I think was more suited for his career aspirations, and we have replaced him with a veteran here at AAR, our Vice President of Engineering, Mickey Cohen, a 35-year veteran of being in the aviation maintenance business, a good solid guy. And so, I think the momentum continues. Mickey has great credibility with the flights of Southwest for instance and under Mickey's guidance here, we have been able to turn, for instance we are performing winglet installations for Southwest. They have numerous providers of this winglet installation , Yes, John had -- for a short period of time, John had been the General Manager., No, we see -- we see flow and I had a blank here in terms of the name but just, we signed Chautauqua up this year. Although it is not the same size as Mesa, it is still a meaningful contract for the company. We continue to look at programs of that nature. The deal flow is still pretty good. I don't want to signal anymore beyond that at this stage but as I indicated earlier, we expect sales growth to continue in the mid double-digit range for that segment of our business and obviously to achieve that level we are going to have to track additional program activity. So, yes I think there is flow. I think the company is performing in the programs that we currently have and we'd all be disappointed if we didn't sign some additional business here this fiscal year., Yes., Roughly for our own account, you are in the 10 range give or take one or two, but basically most of the aircrafts are in joint ventures., Right, correct., I think that ratio of owned is probably a little higher than we would expect, but we have had some interesting situations that we have been able to take advantage of and but I think as we project out further, Greg, and we look at growth opportunities, it will probably be at a higher percentage through joint venture., No, there was no -- there was no real duplication of inventory, or any kind of ramp up, Greg., No, I think we're at the last stages. I wouldn't say that we are completely finished, but we are at the last stages., Yes. So there's 10 hangers altogether that we have contractual access to and as we talked about earlier, currently we are using seven of those 10. So, we can turn on three at our discretion. There is -- I'm not sure if your question asked about – there are two other hangers that are physically attached to the building that are not under our lease agreement. I'm not sure that's what you're asking but those are out there, they are not anything we've asked about but that's the full picture of Indy., Sure. That would be our goal. But, not to repeat myself but our first focus is on improving the profitability., No. I mean, I think there's lots of things we can do on margins at Indianapolis without growing sales from this point., But, I think the ideal -- ideally, we will be running at or near capacity and generating acceptable gross margins., Thank you., Thank you., Okay. Well, the activity that we report there in the Aircraft Sales and Leasing is purely aircraft activity and is not reflecting engine activity. We do have engine activity of this nature as part of our supply chain business and we don't break that out. But it's on the aircraft business, that's all aircraft related., Well, the way I would look at it is that if you look at the operating income contribution from this business, it's up 1.8 million on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and $8.6 million in the year. So, we would anticipate that we'll continue to get acceptable growth rate out of segment of our business. And as I indicated earlier, as we increase the size of the portfolio, we think there will be less volatility and more predictability on the income coming out of this business., Well, the things that could cause it to move might be opportunistic in nature. So if there were a situation that we seized upon opportunistically that we couldn't forecast, that might be something that would be favorable. I am not sure how else to answer that question., Yes. I mean it will change based on the size of the portfolio. So as the portfolio grows, you should see a larger pick up from just the lease rental income. And then it also changes if transactions, as David says, are opportunistically if we exit one of the transactions we are already in., Clearly the MRO business over time will benefit. At this moment in time we are pretty well filled up in our maintenance basis with business that we currently have from third-party customers such as United and Southwest and we have opportunities to expand our business with those customers and that's where our focus on the maintenance side is coming. However, from time to time, there is opportunity to supply spare parts and perform light maintenance work on owned aircrafts, correct., Pretty much unrelated. The order we received today was a business that we have received through our mobility business. Of course Brown is part of our mobility business, but this particular contract was unrelated to Brown. But we're counting on some very exciting things to come from the Brown acquisition. Clearly they bring us a leg on our stool that we didn't have before and we are every excited about what we are seeing so far in the first two months of having that business under our umbrella., No, they are. I think so. Yes. It's good and the Army -- keep in mind now, the Army is relatively new customer base for the company. When I say new, if you looked at coming into this decade we did very little business with the Army, but we have built some good products to support the Army, and yes, we are excited about supporting the Army., Okay probably the next guy., Sure. Fourth-quarter our D&A was $8.1 million., 32.2., Yes, generally speaking our asset base has not shrank at all. So yes, I would imagine it would., Our net debt?, Well, so cash balance was 83.3 million., And bear with us. And we have -- so as we disclosed in the press release, you have recourse debt of 284.2., Non-recourse of 43.6., No, no that's not, that's related to aircraft transactions. Convertible debt we have would be in the 284., It has a positive effect on the cash taxes that we pay. It doesn't really have an effect on the effective tax rate for -- that you would see on the P&L., Yes as we talked about last quarter, we think -- our effective tax rate obviously went up in '07 and we think '08 we should expect it to be in the sort of around where you saw fourth quarter, maybe slightly higher., Yes, well we have authorization and from time to time we explore that and at this moment it's something that we always consider., Yes., 1.5 million shares I believe., Thanks., No, we will start producing these in the next 90 to 120 days, Eric. It is a great piece of business. We think that there is more to come. The demand for this type of product has been strong and we feel good about it. We also are very pleased with the fact that we have got some capacity in the system to go ahead and produce these things, satisfy the customers and grow our business., I would say that the margins are about normal., Right., Yes much, much smaller. But nonetheless it's an opportunity that we hope and expect to win and are excited about., Well, our system has been selected and we expect that our system would be the system that goes into the airplane and Alenia is our customer., Probably not. Probably not., The interest rate is 1.75%. The holders are going to want a premium. It is a good piece of paper for us. It is a good piece of paper for them., So, Eric, let me just stay on Brown that we are very pleased with what we are seeing there in terms of prospects, in terms of opportunities, in terms of upside, okay, without getting into the rest of that on Brown. In terms of our Structures and Systems segment, yes, I mean we are looking for continued growth there. There is demand, we have capacity, and our products are very, very well received. So, yes, we are looking for continued growth., Eric, we are not expecting the sales growth, the sales rate, that this business has contributed in the first two months. I think, again, this is early in the process. We believe that we have a good business to work with here. It complements the other things that we do. I don't think I would go ahead, though and extrapolate two months into a full year's results. So I think it has got good trends. It is a good business. I would leave it at that., We were expecting more than 25 million., Our expectations were higher than that Eric, but as David said, what we saw for the two months was higher than we had anticipated., Yes, so we've rounded to about 33 for the quarter and I am saying we will probably be a little bit up from that. So 34, 35 is probably the right way to model it., Hi, Arnie. So in '07, 18% of the sales were from Europe, 6% were from Asia, and 73% were from North America., And the balance was other., In terms of growth rate and in terms of expectations, I think we are expecting our international sales to grow. There is more and more aircraft moving into the Asian market. There are a lot of opportunities for the company outside of North America. So I think what we're looking for is over the next year, two years, three years an acceleration in our growth rate in both Europe and in Asia., Arnie, I think most of the investments that you're talking about that we have experienced have really been more learning-curve type expenses in the training it's in fact, it's a new aircraft, and as we move on and as the business in Indianapolis, which I think you're referring to, matures. I think there's less and less of that kind of impact. But as I said, it's still a relatively new plant for us. We don't have those kinds of impacts, at least not as significantly at our other MRO shop in Oklahoma. So I think over time the impact of starting up new customers will be less and less noticeable., We need to get that number higher so that we can hit our consolidated corporate goal., Okay., Correct., Right. So as more and more of our aircrafts are held in these joint ventures that will be less and less activity run through the revenue line. But from time to time as David commented, you will see aircraft that are purchased for our own accounts and those of course if those are sold they go through the sales line. But as the portfolio gets larger most of the aircrafts will be run through the joint-venture account or through joint ventures., Right., I think it was six.  Yes., Yes. There will be. And the transaction that Dave referred to which was basically a flip, those are opportunistic. , Yes. I would say that it is a good market. I would say it is a good market. And just if I may give just a little more color on the sales line, even though, first of all the business itself what we are saying here is that we have made a significant step up, if you will, in this business in terms of our involvement. And so I think you should probably expect increases in owned assets as well as in JV assets, even though percentilely I think you'll start seeing more in the joint-venture side just by virtue of having gone from six to nine, for instance, would indicate that you're going to see some sales activity in that business as well. That aspect is a little less predictable than the overall contribution from our Aircraft Sales and Leasing business., Hopefully that's clear., Eric, I think what we are saying is that, and you are correct, we set a target, to be at 10% by this quarter, and that was back when we were in the 7 and 8% range. And if you take a look at operating margins on a year-over-year basis, we've made meaningful progress by finishing the year off at 9.2, is that correct? 9.2%, I am sorry, 9% for the year. And we've kind of indicated why we didn't hit the 10%, but yet as we look short-term, we're looking at 10% and I think what we are also indicating is that in our planning cycle we're looking to be at 12.5%. Now, we didn't expect, quite frankly, we didn't expect the sales growth to be at 22%. We thought the sales growth would be a little bit less. So we are -- I think we are very pleased with the sales growth that we've achieved. Some of that growth has come through the acquisition that you mentioned and that acquisition did not have the margin contribution that we were expecting. It had the gross margin contribution; it didn't have the , There's no question there., Lease rates are good and we expect lease rates to continue to stay good., Yes I mean from time to time you might buy an aircraft with a stub lease on it where the lease rate is not where you want to be, but that is the opportunity for the company. And but for -- on a general statement, lease rates are good., Typically three to seven year leases and you might in the same month buy one with a seven-year lease, you might buy one with a three-year lease. So there is no golden rule in that regard., Thank you., Great. Thanks for your participation. Hopefully we were able to help you understand the company, our performance and the excitements that we have here at AAR., Good morning., Well, I think what we are finding, Arnie, is that the ramp up of employees is taking a little longer than we expected.  And we are committed, obviously, to the customer base that we have in delivering quality products, and we are putting our top mechanics on the Southwest airplanes and some of the other customers we have and we will get the growth that we were expecting.  Previously communicated I should say for April, but it will take a little bit longer., Well, I can tell you that the next quarter or two, our operating efficiency is going to improve; our training expense is going to be lower.  So you should expect improving results coming out of our MRO segment as we look at the, say, the next couple of quarters at least., No. I mean it is out there in the schedule, and there is – we expect the inputs from United to stay steady and we will – that business will be managed through AAR and it's just part of the schedule at this point., Sure, great., Good morning., Very solid performance coming out of our Oklahoma City operation.  They had record sales for the period; they continue to operate very efficiently, very pleased with the results from that operation.  They have ingested the acquisition that we announced and completed back in January, and that's going according to plan.  Our landing gear business is also very strong.  Not quite a record level, but approaching record level, very healthy margins, and I think the company is in a very good position.  We continue to invest in our Malaysian operations and expect sales growth coming out of that region here very shortly as well.  So, all in all, MRO is strong.  Indianapolis – we were down at the Indianapolis last week, very pleased with the reports we are getting from the customers in terms of the service levels that they are receiving from the company, and we are very – I remain very bullish on the prospects for that business., I'm not certain at this point of time, Peter., So I can't say that we – I'm very pleased again with the progress we are making in that area and we do expect to see our fleet size increase in size this quarter.  I'm not certain in terms of what kind of movement out there will be in this period., I think the run rate going forward, Peter, would be maybe just a couple of $100,000 per quarter higher., Say between 2 and $400,000 higher., Great., Good morning., The company continues to improve its presence in that region.  You may recall, Christine, we talked about offices that we have opened up in Shanghai and Zhuhai and in China as well as an office that we recently opened up in Melbourne.  So the company continues to expand its presence in that region.  We continue to make inroads into customers that we previously weren't necessarily connecting with and are very pleased with the organization we have in place in Asia.  It is led by a long-standing veteran of AAR who continues to perform and continues to look for ways to grow our presence in that region.  I'm very hopeful that as we continue to invest in Malaysia that we will see some benefits coming from that – accruing from that as well., Well we feel comfortable at mid-teens, but I don't – it won't be out of the question for us to achieve better than that, but for now at least we are forecasting mid-teens., Yes., How you are doing?, Now if you recall what we said is that the margins were going to be in that 20 to 24 range let's say and if you look at the differential, it's a fairly minor year-over-year.  I think it was what, it was 23.7, now it's 22 and sequentially or vice-versa I guess it was 22.3 last year to 22 this year, so slightly down and sequentially it was down, I guess, 1.7%.  But basically I think you should expect the margins to be in that range.  It's very hard to pinpoint more precisely what the margins might be, but I think if you look at them in the low 20s I think you should be comfortable., Nothing extraordinary during the period, one way or the other and nothing really extraordinary in the prior periods.  It's just a function of mix and timing and things of that nature., I think it's a function of mix.  I think as the mix improves, and the mix should be improving, you should see some improvement.  But it's a very tough business to go ahead and say that you're going to be in any one given quarter that – versus another quarter that we can be that precise in forecasting the gross profit margins.  But we're very comfortable in stating that the gross profit margins will be in that low 20, you know, between 20 and 24, let's say, and you will have some fluctuations from period to period., The volumes are stronger for us today in North America than they are for us in Europe.  We add capacity in both facilities to increase throughput and we're working at increasing sales in both those operations., I'm not aware of there being too much capacity.  I mean, clearly there is competition but I won't state necessarily that there is too much capacity, no., Pricing has been firming.  I believe that we – as it relates to our current position, I think we are in the mode right now where we are absorbing the workload that we have and clearly Southwest came online in January.  We have about 1.5 months of revenue from January in the third quarter results and the fourth quarter will have three months of revenue from Southwest.  We want to do, obviously, a great job for that customer and so far, by all accounts we're meeting their objectives and that's where our focus is right now., We feel good about the growth opportunities in the regional markets that's why we invested in the Reebaire operation. We are currently I would say 75% capacity so there are some growth opportunities for that business.  We continue to expand our engineering service capability and we think next year we're going to be much stronger in that arena than we are today.  In line service work, where we are performing line service work for customers in the Indianapolis, we're looking to expand that into other cities as well., So, all in all, we feel very confident about the opportunity pool that we're facing in the MRO.  Keep in mind once we get our performance level – or our performance to the level that we're comfortable, we do have additional hangar space in Indianapolis to grow and we would anticipate in time that will be the case.  So MRO is – we feel good about it.  We feel good about the quarter we just ended and we think there is a lot of runway ahead of us for improvement., The business continues to be strong.  If you take a look at our Structures and Systems, you know we had modest sales growth of 6% but we had decline in cargo systems due largely to the move.  So we look at the kinds of products that we produce for the DoD.  They are in demand and we don't see that demand declining here in the foreseeable future., Nothing that is extraordinary., I can only give you my view in that regard, Jon, my view is that there is no turning back., If anything that there will be continued momentum.  We are building our value proposition around how we've benefited our customers and I think as we share that with more customers, my view is that it's a compelling case and that's where the trend is heading. I don't see that diminishing., I was talking about net interest first of all, Jon., Okay.  So we've had an increase in interest income as a result of the investments that we were making with our cash.  And interest expense is coming down due to lower borrowing, as well as some capitalized interest on our A400M contract., Right., Sure, sure.  Inventory came down in the quarter by about $16 million mostly due to the sale of those two aircrafts., Our equipment on short-term lease increased.  We've made an investment in some assets to support our supply chain business.  These are assets that were purchased for short-term lease but will shortly be doubled and sold., That business is very healthy as we start producing A400M systems..., ...that should be towards the latter part of next fiscal year, but you should start seeing improvements here beginning in the fourth quarter., I don't believe pressure on margins. We are viewing the DoD differently today than say we viewed the DoD five years ago. We are looking at the – all the branches of the DoD and trying to figure out how we can apply our capabilities to a broader base. And I believe the Armor Holdings transaction is the first leg if you will in terms of making a move along those lines.  I believe that if you look at the budgets and you look at the amount of capital expended by DoD in support of their ground equipment as well as their air equipment it's fairly sizable and as there is a drive for more efficiency, I believe there is more opportunities for us to play a role in that market.  So, I don't view it as necessarily being a drag on margins, as a matter of fact, I think it should be, it should be a pretty good margin.  So, it's a great, an open field for us if you will and we are viewing it very opportunistically., Most of the opportunities that we are seeing today is working with suppliers.  You should know that the DoD points some of the suppliers in our direction because they are pleased with the service we are providing for other OEs.  So, I believe it's more around total system support and we can play a role supporting the owner of the technology., If we are strictly talking about Indianapolis, I would guess that United is in the 20% range give or take.  If we are looking at the entire MRO it's obviously a much smaller – a smaller number., Yes., The vehicle is the Stewart & Stevenson truck, I think it's called FMTV., Right.  And the volumes are modest to start.  And we think we might be able to leverage this into other areas of Armor Holdings and take our capability here into other platforms as well., Yes., Well, we prefer not to – we are not out there with guidance in that regard, and rather than signal any – if our folks are in any negotiations, I don't want to put any pressure on them, undue pressure, I should say beyond what they currently have.  So we prefer not to comment at this point., We're comfortable with growth., Yeah.  I would say that major ingestion is behind us., And by the way, let me just add, Tyler.  I am very pleased with the execution, our team's execution in this regard.  Because really if you speak with the – if you had an opportunity to speak to any of our customers in this regard, they are very pleased with our performance. That's on the government side, if we talk to Northrop Grumman or GE, and if you talk on the commercial side, Mesa, Chautauqua, are very pleased with the support they are getting from AAR., Yes.  No – we are still here., I mean, if you look at the size of the customer base, the customers that we are currently providing services to and you look at the overall scope of the markets that we are servicing, clearly there is opportunities of this size, if not larger out there.  And I believe our organization's challenge, obviously, is getting our story in front of the right customers and convincing them of the merits of this approach.  And I have confidence that over time you are going to see us ink more wins in this regard., Yeah my view, Tyler, is that, we have a three-year planning cycle., And so what we are looking at this, in this three-year planning cycle, we aim to achieve that number., I wouldn't say it's far-reaching, I wouldn't comment to whether there is upside.  I would be very pleased if we get to that goal during this period. And as we continue to refine our business and the products that we are offering, it would be our goal of course to improve upon that.  But I think for this cycle right now, I would be very pleased achieving that level.  As you recall, we were up against the 10% target.  We have a very high level of confidence, and we said that we were shooting, if you recall to the fourth quarter this year and, we have a fair degree of confidence that we will achieve that or get very close to it this quarter.  So rather than go ahead and put another target beyond the 12.5 out there, I think would be incumbent upon us to near that target before we go ahead and start talking something higher.  But, yeah, clearly as we get better at what we do and, as we refine our business model it would be my hope at least that we would be able to run the business at a higher operating margin than 12.5., The MRO side of business has multiple channels of opportunity, if you will.  I alluded to a couple on this call in terms of providing engineering services and providing line services as we get better at what we do we can cycle more aircraft through the hanger space that we have.  You know, our challenge today just so we don't get ahead of ourselves though, Tyler is still to ingest the business that we have.  We have some world-class customers in our facility today and our goal is to continue to work with those customers to get, continue to improve our worth if you will and as we perform, I think there is some more growth, there's considerable growth yet ahead of us in the Indianapolis facility.  Let's leave it at that., Okay., Change and giving up control., The math is compelling.  Well obviously each airline has a different emphasis and, things like how they control their supply chain, how they control the maintenance, how they control the support of the aircraft.  And it's convincing them that relinquishing the responsibility to us is not in any way, shape or form going to diminish service levels, if anything it will improve service levels.  So, you just got to get people comfortable turning over a very integral part of their operation to an independent provider like ourselves., Right. You are correct., Yes.  If you look at the – you have a very complex question by the way.  So let me try to respond to a few of the things, a few of the queries that you have here.  One is the cargo systems business is very highly paced by engineering content.  So the challenge in competing in that market, clearly cost is always an element, but it's also designing a system that works for that operator.  So the key here is maintaining weight levels or reducing weight levels while maintaining stability and strength and all of those kinds of good things.  So the challenge – the principal challenge in that business is engineering.  Now from a – once you have engineered a solution and you have won a contract, now you want to produce this as profitably as possible and that's where the cost element comes in.  So the move to North Carolina is about being in a lower cost environment principally as you said driven by the A400M, because the A400M is the first large scale original equipment program that we have been on., So the move was necessitated by the size of that contract and our desire to be as profitable as possible obviously.  So the – now as we – now that we are in Goldsboro, much to your point, there are opportunities to produce things other than cargo systems and create a manufacturing center of excellence, which we have been doing.  And some of the work actually that came out of Goldsboro in the third quarter was work performed for our Mobility Systems business.  So yes, cargo systems will benefit from the relocation and yes, AAR will further benefit by creating a machining center of excellence that can do work not just on sister AAR company's businesses, but also third-party work for other people looking for low-cost machining solutions., Absolutely.  But keep in mind that the key – the key remains the engineering.  Now we haven't really – our engineering organization is still pretty much intact, it is intact and will continue to do its thing.  But a major point of difference is how effective you are at designing engineering solutions.  So the lower cost element is – yes it make us more competitive clearly, but it is more for our benefit, probably than for the customers' benefit., Yes absolutely, you are correct., Sure.  Depreciation and amortization was 7.9 million, CapEx was 6.5 million. Cash flow from operations, we – I mentioned earlier that we made some working capital investments; receivables were also higher in the quarter.  So we actually had negative cash flow from operations of about 5.8 million, again due to the increase in the receivables driven by the sales and also due to the investments in some inventory assets., Thank you., We've been picking up some of the notes as they've become available, when the pricing is right for us, Peter.  We still think that there are opportunities to deploy our cash into the business, so we're keeping a balanced view there.  So we will continue to buy in the debt as it becomes available., No., Sure.  I will give you the components and you can do the math.  Operating profit was 25,488 million and depreciation and amortization was 7,929 million., Year-to-date depreciation and amortization was 24,089 million and operating profit was 67,183 million., Stan , Yes, I don't see any substantive change in that regard.  I believe the commercial markets are particularly strong and there you are seeing we've had meaningful sales growth, and I believe the defense markets are a little less predictable today, but nevertheless remain fairly strong for the kinds of products and services we provide., I don't know if I have an answer to that question, give us – let us kind of stew on that, and figure how to calculate that better.  But there is still, I would say, capacity., 70%., Let's say 60 to 70., Thank you., Yeah, nothing unusual.  I mean we had exceptionally strong period last year if you recall in defense sales.  So, we are – yeah there's nothing unusual in that regard.  We could use, we are out there knocking on doors trying to get some wins and that would obviously help.  So nothing unusual., Arnie, we have excellent visibility in this segment, our backlog is strong there on the mobility products area.  We're basically sold out for the next at least 12 months.  So great visibility and continued strong demand for the – for our products., No, I don't think we have and I think it changes based on the options., Yeah, we actually provide a size of the contract, and I think what we didn't provide you is, how many units we are estimating that against, but if you look at the Airbus numbers and you can do a division and come out with that answer., Southwest has been outsourcing their maintenance pretty much from their formation, 30 some odd years ago.  So, it's just these aircraft moved from one maintenance organization to AAR.  The kind of work that we are doing is we have, we are doing two different types of support for Southwest, we are doing a winglet mod on their 737-300s, and we are also performing heavy maintenance on their aircraft, different aircraft.  So, if one aircraft comes in for a mod, a different aircraft comes in for heavy maintenance.  And as we perform, Southwest has indicated a desire to put more lines into our facility.  I prefer not to disclose that or discuss that at this point., So, we also expect to be successful and we expect to get more work from Southwest, and we believe we have the capacity to accommodate what they would be interested in outsourcing to AAR., I wouldn't have a specific number for lost revenue; I mean, I think it is more disruption than it is anything that was permanently lost., I think the 10% level is our target.  You know, there is going to be some fluctuations – it gets better as we continue to leverage our cost structure, but I think the 10% is still our goal."
1004,2008.0,Q&A,a,"The pace of activity is okay. Considering that you had had this many aircraft coming out of the system. I think we're sculpting some pretty good action in our business. Clearly, the growth across the segment – the supply chain segment was not where we'd like it to be but if you look at – if you break it down to it's elements, we were impacted by some of the currency issues over in Europe. We did have a softening in some of the European inputs into our component shops. But the main supply chain business, our engine business continues to perform very strongly, very close to double-digit growth, actually 9% sales growth on a year-over-year basis. And I think the – the guys are out there, the inputs are – we are seeing some decent inputs and we would expect that we have made some decent investments here. We would expect that the – we should start seeing decent results, decent growth. We are getting good margins out of the business, so pricing pressure hasn't been there. We are focused on cash so we are looking to turn things a little quicker. Yes, so I think in general it's – the base isn't that bad., Well, I wouldn't say not seeing any – we are – as a balance between trying to get velocity, so moving things -- faster turns, our inventory turns did well, they are up from 3 to 3.1. And so I think we're satisfying our customers, we are giving them good service, good support and we are able to get a fair return for it., Yes, that's for the first six months, that's since May 31., Yes, sure., Yes, Tyler, the opportunities are not too dissimilar to what they did in the past. It's really a function at this point in time of as to how much balance sheet we want to commit; there are opportunities to go ahead and support, various operators it's a function of – as I said the balance sheet that we're being asked to commit and the kind of returns that we expect against those investments. So we are looking at the world I think today appropriately. These are unusual times, capital markets are unusually tight. We haven't necessarily experienced that, but our concern is that our customers may., So we're operating very defensively I would say, yet at the same token looking for those opportunities where we can put our capital to work and get a fair return and protect the balance sheet, make sure that we're making good credit decisions and things of that nature., So, the opportunity pool is, I would say, steady. Clearly, we tried to communicate in today's – yesterday's earnings release, and today's comments is that a couple of segments within the supply chain are still performing quite well. We have seen some follow up in inputs in our European shop, some of that is structural. We're in a high cost environment there in Amsterdam. Our New York component shop is flat, not up, not down. But, of course it's, number wise, it's a drag on the growth rate, because 20 or so on million of revenue that's flat. But the overall, Tyler, I would say that the company is – we are in a good position to benefit as people look to streamline their operation and operate more efficiently things of that nature., Yes, we are up and running in Sacramento. The business is starting to perform. I think as we've indicated before, there is a time lapse, if you will, between getting up and running and starting to book significant business. But I would expect that we will keep to our same commitment in the five-year period that this will be $100 million business., Good morning., I think if their fleet stays constant, then we're probably – we'll probably see a steady flow from hereon out. There might be some fall off, but it's not going to be significant. Now that's assuming that they – their situation stays steady., Yes. I think that's a valid assumption. Clearly, the – it's easier to keep these airplanes in service then it would be to bring, say the 737-300 back into service, so I think as the requirement for lift is there, I think and with the lower price of oil I think these aircrafts make a lot more sense., I would be surprised if it deteriorates. So, my view is that, you will see more growth in the second half of the year than – or third and fourth quarters than you saw in this period., Well, both are kind of even if you will; we had a good mix, and we had a nice improvement in cargo systems. So I think a combination, Eric. I think it is too hard to delineate one versus the other. I think they both kind of contributed to the improvement., Well, yes, I think the contribution from the cargo systems business is going to be with us. I think in addition to mix that some of the other Structures and Systems businesses, Eric, we're also getting some operating leverage. So I think we feel good about the sustainability of the margins in this kind of range., Well, you're going to start to see the benefits of those wins immediately. And it's true that they do in some cases replace existing work that's been completed. But we are looking for some incremental results as these contracts start to deliver., We are getting the shelter award, Eric., As that ramps up, yes., It ramps up over the next couple of months and goes for longer than that., No. No, the aircraft that we've written down are the aircraft that – we have four aircrafts in our inventory, that are pre 9/11. One is on a leverage lease with Continental that has four more years to run, and we feel that aircraft is properly valued. The other three aircraft – and keep in mind, coming out of 9/11, we had about 12, 15 aircraft. So we've worked our way through all of the aircraft except to these remaining three aircraft. So we – in assessing the overall economic environment and taking a look at our fleet, we felt that there was an opportunity here to go ahead and market these – take these things from a lease position and put them into a sale position., So we had two MD-83s and one 737-300 and we sold – we ended up – after we made this decision, we sold one of the MD-83 towards the end of the quarter and just took the appropriate assessment, I believe, on the other two aircraft. We looked at the rest of the fleet, and the rest of fleet's in good shape. I would say, if anything, we have embedded gains as opposed to embedded losses in the balance of our fleet., Keep in mind, in the period we also sold two airplanes with a very nice healthy return. So we have three aircrafts sold, one that we've had inventory for quite some time, and the other two that we bought in the last few years. So, most of the aircraft portfolio that we have today are recently acquired aircraft. And so we do an assessment on all the things you mentioned on discounted cash flows, on market values, recent sales transactions and our assessment of the viability of that part of our fleet., Keep in mind also now the – as I've indicated, the investment that we have in this fleet is $80 million; and we believe that we have – to your point about embedded losses or embedded gains, we believe we have embedded gains in the balance of our portfolio. By the same token, I think I've indicated our goal here is to continue to sell down our fleet, and based on how we do the market today, sell down our fleet and generate cash and put the cash to better use at this moment., Well, I think what we've said is on the aircraft side. We haven't bought an aircraft since November 2007. So we saw the markets getting a little bit squirrelly, if you will, a year ago. So we've not added to our fleet in that time period. So yeah, I don't believe that we would be looking to take the cash and buy more aircraft for lease now. We have made some investments and support of Supply Chain, we've made investments in support of Structures and Systems, and we will continue to do so. We also – as you saw, we, I think advantageously acquired some of our bonds as well. So, yeah, I think we have places where we can put the money to, I believe, better use., No, the United deal is, we basically – what's happened with the United deal is, we've seen the world a little bit differently in terms of valuations. We've brought them certain offers against the aircraft which they've rejected, and we basically have gone separate ways on that transaction at this point in time. So we're still out there trying to move some stuff, but we no longer have a formal relationship in that regard. And we do not have any commitments to acquire any aircraft., Yeah., Good morning., The MROs were busy in the second quarter. We've been talking to customers, both new and existing about some holes we have in the third quarter schedule and in the fourth quarter. We're reasonably optimistic we're going to be able to fill those holes. But clearly with the fleet reductions there's less aircraft out there to fix. So like I said, I mean I think we're holding our own, but we do have some holes., In Q3, Indy was pretty close to full. They've been where they had been for the most part., Q2., We do. We do think it's marketable. We watch our turns very closely, the turns picked up a little bit in the quarter. The aging looks good. We do have, as you know, about $19 million of pre 9/11 inventory in the supply chain that continues to sell. We're watching it very closely. The sales activity, while it's constant, is still at relatively low level. So we've got a close eye on that. But apart from that, we feel good about the salability of the inventory., I think we like the platforms that we've invested in over the past 24 months. We think that it's the right place to be. But I think we're in a good position., But let me just add a little color if I may, and that is that in the last downturn, our inventory was turning about 2.4 times, and our inventory now is turning at 3.1 times., We have one more that comes due in May. Other than that, we don't have any rollovers for a year. So we have two aircraft that are currently parked, one of which we hope get sold as early as tomorrow. The second one will probably go into disassembly and then we have another aircraft that comes off lease in May., That's correct., They are both joint-venture aircraft., About 25% military JV., Yes., Relative to the carrying value of the aircraft..., These were – it was relatively significant, it was about a little better than half., Jon, and again the reason for that is these aircrafts were a small subset that were pre 9/11, so they were acquired at a different time and under different kind of model than we have done over the last several years. So they were definitely outliers in the portfolio., Relative to the rest of the portfolio., So there's no debt against these aircraft, these aircraft were not only wholly owned but no debt associated with them as well., First of all, we're not saying that we're going to sale three this quarter. We took those two and we marketed them for sale., We have a high level of confidence in another airplane being sold tomorrow. But that's not one of these two airplanes that have just recently been marked down. We do have them for sale, but we don't have necessarily any takers at this moment., So we have the one aircraft that we have a high level of confidence in selling. As it relates to what was – in terms of what we will do with the proceeds – and I think there is any number things to do with – any number of possibilities with the proceeds, one of which would be to buy in more debt., You are talking about the information we provided in the release --, -- is that what you are comparing that to?  Yeah. It's – the squaring of that is we have drawn some of the -- from the revolving credit facility., So I was taking out some of the convert debt, we do have some drawn on our facilities., That's why you are seeing a net difference., Sure., What are the new levels?, You're saying how to , Yeah, I think you're going to have to probably wait a little bit on that, , You are talking about commodity prices in the market in general?, Coming down? Yeah, I mean, I think that benefit settlement is – I mean, you and I've talked a little bit about exposure to raw material price volatility. I think, I mean, there is clearly some benefit we get from falling prices. And there is some challenge with rising prices. But in general, we have some pretty good operational hedges against volatility price – volatility in those input costs., Again this is an area really that just pertains to our manufacturing businesses as you know, and our manufacturing businesses are really only about 30 to 35% of the overall enterprise. So then within that manufacturing business set, we do, do a mix of both cost plus contracts as well as firm-fixed-price bids. And the risk of prices changes will only be with respect to those firm-fixed-price contracts., So we keep shrinking it down and then within firm-fixed contracts, some of that work we do on behalf as a sub to a Tier 1 prime, and in most cases often times we have a right to buy arrangement under their supply contracts. So we don't get exposed to changing prices. We basically – what we bid to them we get to buy at the same price. So we have a number of operational related, I guess, hedging strategies or techniques that insulate us from the movement of these prices., Well, I think what I would kind of do to give you more of a generic answer., In the second quarter, we were operating at levels that were similar to what we've talked about in the past. As you know United pulled their aircraft and grounded their fleet, they are in the process of grounding it. We were able to replace that with some additional work from a customer. That customer requirements thin out in Q3 and then come back later on – in later Q4. So we're looking for other customers as well as that customer to help us fill that – those gaps., The three aircraft right., We think that there is a lot of opportunity there. They are a good customer as you say. And we are looking for ways to go ahead and help them succeed in their merger., I don't think so. I mean – we think they are still struggling with the – that Propulsion System., I think they're talking 2010, And I don't know how much – I think they still have some issues there., It's not going to be 2009., Yeah. It's about 10.5 million, Larry., No., Eight million for the quarter, Eric. And I think our projections for the year is probably still where we had been, which is – I think we've been talking about 30 to 40 million. And we're probably a little lower in that range than higher in that range right now. But it's still in that zip code., Avborne is a combination of contracts and dropped in. And they have done a really nice job I think filling some of the holes  that they have. They have got a customer that's large and relatively new to them, that's been putting work in there. But that business, you are right, more than any of the other MROs has less visibility than you would like to see. But they're still getting work. They are getting lease return work. They're getting some special business so they are doing okay. They have holes too obviously. But they are doing okay., It's a new customer for them since we bought them, to my knowledge., Sure., Absolutely., Well, it's closer to dead than alive. It still could happen. But it's not something that we are counting on or talking much about., Jon, the increase was, just to be clear, was our bad debt provision, the P&L hit., When you see the balance sheet and you see our bad debt actual reserve, you won't see a change much because frankly we have wrote off as many things as we actually provisioned for., Just to be clear. But to the core of your question, the answer is yes, it's specific. We go through all of our outstanding receivables and determine our provisioning based on where the need is on a line item by line item basis., What period of time are you referring to, I mean, if you're looking at from a long haul standpoint, then I'm very comfortable in that range. If you're looking at from a quarter-over-quarter basis I'm not certain because we have the ingestion of some of the acquisitions. So I think our growth rate is going to be challenged as it relates to the overall environment and the way we're managing the business., So we're managing the business to protect the balance sheet and at the same token we're looking at opportunities and keeping as fine a balance as we can. So I think the growth rate we experienced this quarter, I think is acceptable. And I think I'm trying – what I'm trying to signal is that we feel pretty good about our business today and where we stand, our position, the investments we've made. And our goals would be to get back to that middle double-digit growth rate that you're referring to., Yes, Larry, if you normalize for the effect of the acquisitions and the change in our Sales and Leasing segment..., On a year-over-year basis you'd get a number about 12%., Yes, it's just probably dilution from stock options and things like that, Larry. It will be a little bit different because of where the share price is right now, but there were no repurchases, to answer your question., Well we feel better of about oil at 100 than we did at 135 and we'll feel better about it at 60 or 80 than we do at 100. So as the price of oil moves downward it's more positive for our customers. I think it's more positive for everybody., So, yes, it would be more positive – as it goes down it's more positive for us., Yes, it's interesting, Troy. Obviously we're getting some decent sales growth through our businesses. Without making any major announcements, the flow is quite robust, we were hopeful of having a couple of larger deals signed by now, but it's hard to get people get to that point right now and maybe they're focused on other things, I'm not certain. But our business is very strong, the deal flow is very strong. We feel very good about the Supply Chain businesses and hopefully we'll be able to convert some of the discussions we're having with people into firm contracts. We are a little surprised that some of the stuff hasn't happened by now, but at the same token there's still ample flow and we're very focused on the things we're talking about, our margin and cash flow and getting good returns, getting our assets to turn, things of that nature and we want to make certain that as we enter or look to enter into deals of this nature that they meet our criteria., Yes, we're having discussions in both camps in both our defense businesses and also our commercial customers, yes., Just to be clear, Troy, your question is how much of that 500 will come in through the balance of fiscal '09?, We don't have an exact number on that, but I think it's fair to say probably somewhere between a half and three-quarters of it., I'd say what we're trying to signal with that backlog is just show you that the pace of activity within the company is strengthening. And if you look at the sales growth, you look at the sales growth on an organic basis, I mean in every respect we're getting good double-digit growth and we don't see that tailing off at this stage., Yes, we're going to look very closely at our cash, at our ability to generate cash from the businesses and as we generate cash from the businesses we will look for the best ways to apply that cash and we felt during this period that this was a good way to apply our cash., The investors are going to be very happy with the return that we have on these two sales. The pricing was – good pricing in line with our expectations when we made the investments and we will end up with very healthy returns from the sale of these two assets., Well we have one additional aircraft that comes off lease here in the second quarter, we are in active discussions on the sale of that aircraft. The other two aircraft come off lease in the second half of the year and those two aircraft we're in advance discussions with people on leasing those aircraft. Those aircraft are a little newer and right now we view it as more a better use to go ahead and put those out for lease with other players, so that's being worked on as we speak., Yes, it's a good question. Obviously United went out into the market and looked for folks who could help them in this regard and they selected AAR and we are out there aggressively trying to move this hardware for them. We through our Aircraft Sales and Leasing business we have an advisory service capability and we've been out there trying to help financial institutions understand their positions with some of the assets they have, as well as help them reposition some of those assets. So it's hard to say exactly how that will shake out for us, but we have over the past, we developed this advisory service capability post-2001 and had some success through the earlier part of this decade. And I would expect that as aircraft are being repositioned that AAR will have its hand in a few of these, so yes, I mean I wouldn't get overly excited about it, but it's another way for us to make some money., Yes, in this case, in the case of the United it's a flat fee. We get a flat fee for moving the aircraft for them., Yes, mostly, in some cases it's a percentage and in some cases you get a flat fee, it depends on the circumstances., I don't see any real reason for that. I think our businesses, I think what we're trying to signal here is that we had a pretty good first quarter and first quarter is seasonally a little bit lower than other quarters that we typically experience due to aircraft operating as opposed to being down for maintenance. There's some unusual dynamics going on today with aircraft in the process of being parked, but if you look at our – monitoring our business if not weekly, daily, things seem to be pretty brisk, so yes, we're holding to our growth rates., Yes., Good morning., Hey, Eric., My sense is that the environment is such that you're going to see continuation of bankruptcies around the globe with airlines, with the confluence of worldwide economy, as well as the price of oil. As the price of oil moves down it takes some of that risk away, but you can assess the world economy as well as we can. My sense is that you're going to continue to see bankruptcies and you're going to see a little pressure on us in this regard for at least the next couple, three quarters, that would be my guess., Yes, well it starts on the front end obviously in selecting who you issue credit to and then it goes to its credit terms and then it goes to collections and hopefully and we can control some of the assets and have agreements that allow us to sell those assets if in fact the customer doesn't pay their bills. So we've unfortunately we've been through this drill many times, so we know what it's like to work through these tougher financial environments and airline bankruptcies is not something that is new to us it's something we've experienced here. I've been here since 1979 and we've seen a rash of bankruptcies through all the decades and we have that drilled down pretty good., Well let's start off with the first part of your question and that is that we're not usually out there forecasting sales in this regard and in this particular case we have a contract signed for the sale of the two aircraft. We have a high level of confidence in the customer's ability to finance the aircraft. In terms of signaling what the gain might be I don't think that would be smart on our part to go ahead and do that, so we'll hold off on that. But suffice it to say, Eric, that you've seen what our historical returns have been I believe in that area and this one meets our historical returns., Sure, D&A for the quarter was $11 million. On top of that we had about a little over 8 million of CapEx and our operating cash flow we consumed just over $10 million of cash flow from operations. So obviously the depreciation and amortization number is inside there, but those are your three data points., We saw some very good opportunities and we decided to seize on those opportunities. The focus is still on cash generation. We may from time-to-time look at opportunities as we see them. I mean if you take a look at the margin growth that we're experiencing in that Supply Chain group, when you take a look at the sales growth notwithstanding pullback from the Mesa operation, I think we're utilizing cash I think intelligently and we're positioning the company for further growth. So we will continue to look for opportunistic buys in this regard. Secondly we have a tremendous demand in two of our businesses in particular, the SUMMA operation and the landing gear operation. In both cases we're investing in those businesses. We also are in the final throws of developing or coming online with a paint capability in Indianapolis and these all required capital in this period and we're highly confident that we'll get very good returns from those investments., Great., Specific accounts, Jon., No, as you heard from David earlier, we reduced the size of the relationship with Mesa, so right off the bat we're not quite as big and in particular that reduction came around the Supply Chain business. And in addition to just taking down the size of the relationship we've also restructured some of the terms and some of the main features of these agreements, including some of the payment terms, all with an eye towards reducing some of our balance sheet and cash flow risk., We'll keep monitoring the situation. Mesa has been a good customer for us and is honoring all aspects of their contractual relationships with us. We know they have some challenges as a business, as all airlines do. But we'll keep working with them and if we think it makes sense to continue to adjust we'll do that., At this time we're still business as usual with Southwest. At Indianapolis we're very busy with them. I think we're doing a good job for them and at this point at least we expect that to continue., So we're making good progress. We are waiting on some final inputs from Airbus in terms of some of the details on specifications on the program. I think it's progressing well from our end and I think it's – I'm not sure that that Airbus is out there with a production date, but we're expecting to deliver in late fiscal '09., Absolutely, I mean if you take a look at this quarter you have some issues with the credit adjustment, if you will or the bad debt adjustment, I should say. But if you look at year-over-year, first quarter last year I think was 9% and we should have been or it was a little less than that actually., 8.8., 8.8%, so if you backed out I guess the bad debt we would have been at 9 or a higher percent. So yes I think, Stan, that the focus is around margin generation. We had no aircraft transactions in the quarter. Next quarter we will, those come out of joint ventures, so those will add nicely to our operating margin and yes, we're holding to our goal of being at that 12.5% level., Yes, if you look at the multiple that we are attracting, it appears that our shares are a pretty good investment. So as we generate cash we're going to look at different ways that we can put that cash to work, some of which might be through acquisitions to go ahead and continue to broaden our portfolio and balance our portfolio and also through looking at how we can strengthen the balance sheet and give our shareholders a good return., Thank you, sir, thank you., Yes, correct, Well, Hense, as David said, he thought we said that it's approximately 200 basis points of growth rate, so in dollar terms that's about $20 million., Are you asking about Supply Chain or in general?, Well I think, Hense, if you look backwards there's a very recognizable seasonal pattern to the company and to the business and in particular the Supply Chain segment. So it's pretty common that the first quarter of a new fiscal year is lower in absolute dollars than the fourth quarter of the prior year. It's reflective of obviously airline customers, commercial accounts obviously try to have as many aircraft as possible in the air during the summer months., I wouldn't read too much into that and I think the growth rate has been fairly steady. There is some, from time to time there's a little bit of lumpiness, so you might have a transaction that closes in the period that it doesn't get duplicated the next period. But I think trend-wise the business has been growing in this 10 to 15% range each quarter and I don't think there was any aberration in this quarter at all., Yes, we don't – we didn't have those stats available, so maybe what I would tell you, Hense is reiterate some guidance we've given in the past. In our Structures and Systems the piece that would be non-organic would be the impact from SUMMA., And SUMMA in the past we've talked about that as being roughly $25 million a quarter business topline., And in the MRO the only difference would be the impact of the acquisition of Avborne and we've previously talked about Avborne being about a 50 to $60 million a year acquisition as well., Well we'll have to get back to you off line on that..., Yes, United's expectations of taking those aircraft out of service will obviously have something to do with when any transactions close. And United will I'm sure continue to adjust some of their timing or they have the potential to adjust some of the timing, so I mean it's very difficult for us to predict because it's a function of what their requirements will be. Their stated intention is to get out of their 737 fleet by third quarter of '09, calendar '09. And then obviously it is also a function of what the market demand is for the aircraft, so hard to say. It's a long-winded way of saying hard to say exactly what the timing will be., Yes, first of all ILFC has been toying with this idea for quite some time. The weakness in AIG has been known to those folks for a while and actually the chap who is CEO of ILFC is the largest individual shareholder of AIG. So they have been toying with this for quite some time. The impact on the industry, the impact on the leasing market should not be too dramatically different. I'm assuming that they are going to successfully be spun out of the – I guess today it's largely owned by the US government, so I don't think the US government wants to be in the aircraft leasing business too long. So most likely that business will be independent and they probably will have some success in arranging financing and I'm not going to say necessarily business as usual, but the bigger impact is on the order books of the Boeing and Airbuses where they have I think 18 billion on backlog with those two guys. So in terms of the impact on the leasing business as we know it today, we're not expecting any impact from that., Hense, we did some quick calculations on the organic growth rates for the Structures and MRO segments and they're both approximately 16%., Can you be a little more specific, Alex, because when you say didn't blink an eye at the financing, what are you talking about?, Financing for what?, The aircraft we're going to sell?, Okay, yes, I mean I think our response was for the aircraft we're going to sell we were not concerned about the perspective buyer's ability to finance., Yes, I think we share that view. It was a relatively tough summer with a fair amount of disruption. We lost the United lines at Indianapolis and were able to pick up work to replace that. It was slow in Miami, so, yes I think we feel like the first quarter, all things considered, was decent in MRO and we're optimistic that that we're going be in a position to improve from those levels., I don't necessarily see that. I mean ILFC I think what, had 1,000 airplanes in their portfolio, if I'm not mistaken, 900 and there's 18,000 airplanes in the world. So I'm not so certain that a change in their ownership structure is going to have much of an impact on the world leasing market. I wouldn't expect that. I think the biggest risk I think to the ILFC story is the order book and the backlog because like I indicated, I think it's been publicized that they have 18 billion of aircraft on order. So I think that is more of a, I think, kind of a white flag than -- a red flag than what might happen to the worldwide leasing market., You know David commented, Eric, on some of the fluctuations and volatility in the operating margins particularly in the Aviation Supply Chain segment where it can be impacted by specific transactions. So I would expect that you'll continue to see kind of volatility within some kind of normal range in this segment, but we're across the company driving for improved margins. So irrespective of that volatility, we're looking to see margins improve., So there's a lot of good things going on within the Structures segment both from a topline perspective and margin perspective. There's initiatives within the businesses to improve margins. There's I think some I'd say relatively low hanging fruit maybe, but on the other hand the mobility business is hitting on all cylinders and delivering excellent performance. So I think we're really very positive about the growth opportunities there and I think there is room for margin improvement across those businesses., I'd say that they are doing very nicely and they're looking at some really kind of game changing opportunities., Yes, there was a gap of in some cases a few weeks and in some cases a little less and then you also had kind of a transition impact as well of kind of re-training and tooling to get ready for the new lines., Well obviously there's a lot of moving pieces all the time, right? But, yes, I think as I said earlier there were some headwinds in Q1 that we were able to overcome and it gives us encouragement for the next quarter and beyond., It's exclusive for a particular lot of aircraft and exclusive with some agreed upon carve outs of other names, yes., Eric, you could get that from their..., Data, but roughly about half., So they owned about half and half are about leased and as Tim said, it's an exclusive arrangement with a few carve outs that they had sold a couple of airplane already and they are in discussions with some parties that they'd already started. So those are obviously grandfathered into the deal., Not, again, yes, not beyond the names that we grandfathered in, right., Yes, the Mobility business has a very strong backlog the mix is favorable. We're continuing to see opportunities for new business with -- for new products so we feel good about the -- about the prospects there both from volume and mix for a while. Whether it's three quarters or nine quarters I don't know but the backlog is good for at least another year., I would say that – there's a good amount of activity. Some large, some medium and some small. And they run the gamut from the various customers we support so and I think that at this point I think that the activity is -- the activity level is good., No, it's -- I'd say it's about the same. I think there is several opportunities that we're working on out there., This is not a business we acquired. It's a facility that was fully equipped by the U.S. Air Force back in the 90s for composite manufacturing. So we are a lessee if you will, of a facility. It's a long-term lease and as the lease progresses the equipment inside the facility becomes the property of the company. The opportunities are in the commercial Aerospace space, Defense as well as the business jet and General Aviation segment. So it's pretty much across the board we have, as you know a composite business already in existence located in Clearwater, Florida. It's been very busy, it's somewhat limited by the number of autoclaves. In this particular lease we pick up four additional autoclaves, two of which incidentally have never been turned on., So the reason that we expect to ramp up in our first quarter, which is beginning in June let's say, is because the facility needs to be reenergized and reopened basically. So we see a fair amount of demand, or I should say excessive demand in this area, we have the talent, we believe in-house and we've actually hired some additional folks, to go ahead and build this into a very productive segment within AAR. To a certain extent, I think one way of looking at this business is very similar to how you might look at Indianapolis for our MRO business, I think it's an opportunistic move by the company in an area that appears to be chalked full of demand., No, the work that's in Clearwater will stay in Clearwater, and this will be new work that we will attempt to attack. Now, we might get the plant started by shifting some work elsewhere from AAR into the facility and so that might be, take up, at least get us off and running, but once we get over the early stages, we do expect to attract new business., If you take a look at the growth that we've experienced in our Aircraft Sales and Leasing segment, a lot of that growth has come from our ability to acquire aircraft in the U.S. market, and then place those aircraft into international markets. Our demand for air travel does not appear to be easing at this point in time, as I indicated in my comments, we're obviously watching this to see what the effects of the U.S. economy might have on domestic travel. So we expect some of -- let's call it some of the older technology aircraft may be parked, but we do believe that if newer technology aircraft get parked, there will be plays elsewhere. We view that as an opportunity both for our Aircraft Sales and Leasing segment as well as for our supply chain and possibly for our MRO to put those aircraft back into service with another operator. So we -- although we believe that you might have some come-down here in North America, we don't believe that worldwide travel or traffic numbers are declining., We have received some inquires along those lines, we have yet to secure any business on the heavy maintenance side, we're hoping that having this Miami business will facilitate that opportunity and -- but time will tell, at this point in time the exchange rate obviously is favorable in this regard, and it might lead to certain volume – opportunities for the company. I would expect this incidentally more obviously wide-bodies than narrow-bodies; narrow-bodies don't tend to go across the ponds. But we might see some opportunities along these lines. We clearly are seeing some benefits on other businesses from the exchange rate and we are working diligently on the Structures and Systems business in that regard. Keep in mind all of our manufacturing capability is here in North America. So we do have -- we do see that as a potential opportunity for the company., SUMMA is a very exciting acquisition for the company in that it puts another leg on our stool within our Structures and Systems group. Our Structures and Systems group today consists primarily the mobility activity as well as specific manufacturing of products for cargo systems and then we have the composite leg and the SUMMA gives us what we believe is the foundation for an aircraft parts manufacturing piece of our Structures and Systems group. So, you are correct in terms of the annualized revenue base we are hoping to be able to build from that., SUMMA has very good relations, very time-tested relationships with some of the major OEs in the aircraft manufacturing business and we're hoping to capitalize on those and be able to hopefully as a result of this move into McClellan. McClellan will have able -- will be able to benefit from some of the deep ties SUMMA has with many of these OEs. So, the SUMMA acquisition you are correct in term of its size, but I just want to highlight the fact that it does bring us some dimension that we didn't previously have within our Structures and Systems biz., So, SUMMA is not a bolt-on, SUMMA is kind of adding a leg to our stool. As it relates to Avborne, Avborne is similar in terms of basic fundamental capability with Indianapolis other than SUMMA has -- I mean Avborne has some success on Airbus airplanes and also wide-body aircraft. The hangars there built in such a way that they can accommodate wide-body aircraft and also Avborne gives us a location that we believe is a very important location as we round out our MRO capability here in North America. So, Avborne is more of -- more of a bolt-on and SUMMA might be yet Avborne does bring us certain dimensions that we didn't previously have., Good Morning, We -- I think the number there is a little more challenging Tyler, because of whether we decide to work narrow-bodies, wide-bodies et cetera. So I think we've been – we've held back from providing that number now. I think the best thing you could do is you can interpolate a little bit on the square footage pace and I think you also, you know where our acquisition price is and you can sort of hone in on as a multiple of revenue from that. As we get maybe a firmer mix on where we'll go with the workload then maybe we'll be better positioned to give you some better guidance., You know, Tyler, Avborne is busy, they've got a lot of airplanes coming in and out of there, but it's not a nose to tail shop like you're accustomed to seeing in Indianapolis. So -- and that's one of the things that we expect to bring in there is, maybe not the whole place, but allocate more of the capacities nose to tail. So it's very busy when I was there last week, they actually had 15 aircraft around the facility, some were in there for overnight checks, some were in for two-day checks and some are in there for 60 days. So, it's a little difficult to characterize it the same way you might characterize Indy., Yes., Expiration., Yeah, I guess a lot of -- as we make some of these acquisitions, there -- some of these acquisitions have margins below even the 10% that we're looking at and so we have some challenges, yet we view them as opportunities to go ahead and get margin improvement., Well, of course half of that first -- second half of the year is gone away, we didn't make any announcements, so obviously we're now in the last three months. We still believe -- there is a possibility of at least one of these hitting this quarter, but I would push out some of the balance; just based on the overall gestation period I would push out the balance into next year. But suffice to say if you recall, last quarter's supply chain we had sales growth of less than 10%, it was eight and change, I believe. This quarter we said we will come in above -- against double digits, we came in 11.5. There is no shortage of opportunities in that business segment and some of them are program related, some are look like programs, but we are not calling them programs but the, let's put it this way, the pace of business is very brisk., Well, we definitely saw the bad weather., But no significant impact in our operations., We didn't have the magnitude that they seem to have had., Let me just reiterate what you said and that is I mean that is the growth rate within our MRO segment was truly exceptional, 43% growth rate that's all organic. I believe it's around -- as we've talked about before, it's around execution; our MRO team is executing, I think, beautifully and customers are very satisfied with the workload and looking for AAR to take more work if we can and I really would like to just congratulate Tim and his team in this regard because they are doing a heck of a job. It's not like this business is just hanging out there for somebody to grab. I mean this is, you are throwing up a 43% growth rate in a market that is relatively flat and my sense is that this is all about our team performing and getting that kind of a growth rate., The MRO market is -- the MRO business is a very detail oriented business. Obviously you are talking about safety of flight and we at AAR understand that. We've been in the MRO business through our Oklahoma operations for many years, we are very focused around the detail of the work that we do having the paperwork, having training in place as you recall. Each of our technicians receives training pretty much every year, the last three or four years we've received the Diamond Awards from the FAA for having every technician at AAR go through training. Now, it's a very complex -- bringing aircraft through a maintenance cycle is a very complex process. In the case of Southwest, managing a fleet as wide as they are is very complex and I think everybody has pretty much reiterated it's -- the safety record of the world's airlines is truly remarkable. There is a chain if you will a safety chain, the AAR is a major part of and this is an area that we stay very focused on and pay a lot of attention to the details, and the procedures, and the processes, and the paperwork and all that kind of stuff., So, I think if you look at the world that we are in as a kind of a flight to quality then I think quality providers will be in very good position to benefit if in fact there are some folks who are not necessarily as adept or as detail-oriented as this business requires. So, I feel very -- our head is down if you will and we're making certain that we have -- we are doing all the things we're supposed to do and we are paying a lot of attention to this segment and really no different than we always have. I mean this is a -- as I said it's very detail-oriented business and you got to pay attention to a lot of different things, and there are from time to time there are slips and the important thing is that the organization has processes in place that capture these slips before they become a problem. So, yes, I believe overall that in the general flight to quality let's say, as long as we continue to execute the way we are, we should be a beneficiary., I believe that's always the -- that's within the power of the FAA. The FAA has oversight and all of the licensed facilities that carry FAA designation. So they have the ability to monitor on a minutes notice. They have the ability to send staff and teams into facilities that have AA certificates. They have the ability to go through their procedures to make sure they are operating within the regulations and if they deem them not to be operating within the regulations they have the ability to pull their ticket., And from time to time over the years they've exercised that privilege., I think in terms of them officially recommending a vendor, one vendor versus another to their customer is probably not in their purview. But I mean obviously listen, when two guys are having a discussion, probably it might not be uncommon for somebody to give an opinion to somebody else and that can always happen., Okay., Well, that's a complicated question. Let me try to answer it as succinctly as I can. Clearly there is obviously, at least U.S. maybe it's international, liquidity crunch which we're very well aware off. We are currently our fleet is fully leased, we have recently actually renegotiated couple of leases in our favor where the leases had rolled over and the new rate is at a higher number than the old rate. In terms of the sales of assets in the quarter that we concluded, February 29th, we were successful in selling two of our existing aircraft on a cash basis to the buyers who either had the money or financed it., On the side of availability, and I think what we're trying to signal in today's conference call and on my comments was that we believe that the liquidity pressures on some of the players will create a certain amount of opportunity and we are paying very close attention and talking with those who have been publicized have liquidity problems and own aircraft and those who might not be publicized but may in fact have liquidity concerns. So we are fairly optimistic in this regard that as a result of some of the liquidity pressure that there will be aircraft -- opportunities for our aircraft Sales and Leasing business. Now we are raising our hurdle rate to take into consideration the overall risk environment so we would anticipate and -- kind of looking ourselves as -- maybe the option though, the last choice let's say because we pay very close attention to the acquisition prices that we pay for these assets keeping in mind our view, at least of the risk profile of this market. So all of that was -- what I'm trying to saying in as concise a fashion as I can say is that we are aware that there are owners of aircraft who have liquidity concerns, problems, I should say, and we believe we're in a good position to benefit from that., Thank you., So D&A for the quarter was 10.4 million, which brings year-to-date right at 30 million, or just slightly shy of 30 million., That reflects a full quarter of all the acquisitions we made other than Avborne, which obviously just closed at the beginning of this quarter. So I think that rate for Q3 is a pretty good run rate, you got to adjust for current CapEx and you've got to -- and then layer on something for Avborne, I don't have that Avborne number right now, but it tends to be a more labor- intensive then capital-intensive business., Yes. The only, caveat to that is, we do have purchase accounting to apply to the acquisition that will create some amortization that wouldn't otherwise have been in their P&L. So -- I don't have that number handy, but I mean you could do based on the purchase price and some general allocations you could probably estimate that pretty closer, easily., Diluted shares is something that -- what you see right now in the current quarter should not change dramatically, you have a little bit of ups and downs for either stock repurchases on our part or some option exercises or things like that but that's pretty minor. It wouldn't be until we got to a much higher stock price than we are now that you would see any dilutive effects from the recent convert we did., Little over 35. Correct., It comes in under a treasury stock method of accounting, so it's a function of what the actual stock price is at the time., So you shouldn't see any real share change until you get into the $35 plus stock zone and then it begins to come in slowly. On the net debt, you'll see from the press release, what our recourse debt looks like at this juncture. As David mentioned earlier, we did contract to -- we entered into a repurchase agreement to buyback some money some amount of our secured notes and beyond that it's a function of what we do with our cash and how we invest in the business. So I think I'm more comfortable telling you that gross debt you can see that and then we have a fair amount of cash on hand at the end of the quarter and we'll deploy that as we see business opportunities., Did you say India?, Okay. What's the question?, They are a major contributor to the MRO results for the quarter. We are not at full capacity yet, and we're getting good use out of the space that we currently occupying -- there is some space, additional space for us to occupy. We are in discussions with the landlord about trying to figure out how to get more space at that airfield in one way or another. So at this point in time that business is strong, the demand is strong, I believe that some of your -- short-term capacity opportunities that we might see that we can handle there, part of our plan is that some of that work would be done down in Miami., So yes, Indianapolis is strong, we continue to -- we are seeing some benefits from some of the sideline activities including engineering services, this is an area we highlighted, Stan you might recall couple of years back, we started to get some traction here this quarter. We hope to build on that segment of our business as well and sell more of our intellectual property to customer bases -- is looking for those kinds of solution., No., No, the owner of the facility and don't hold me to this is at the airport authority that is basically backed up by the State of Indiana, the city of Indianapolis and there are some bonds -- bondholders that obviously have a position now in that facility as well. So I mean we deal with the airport authority and like I said we're looking right now for ways to even take on more space in Indianapolis., Potentially. And potentially there is a couple of hangars in that facility that we do not control., Controlled by others., The regional airline., We haven't seen that yet. We saw that -- we seen kind of steady -- that kind of steady piece of the business let's say, if I go back to '03, so we saw some of the benefits back when the airlines were reducing capacity in the '03, '04, '05 time period. So we made some investments and assets during that time period, which we've been able to place elsewhere, in this current let's say, trust we have not seen aircraft that have actually serviceable airplanes that hit the market. We have seen airplanes for disassembly that hit the market and we have procured some of those in prior periods., I think then that was part of the strategy behind our offering in February, was to get us additional liquidity and put us in a stronger position, the benefits from kind of its movements and I think -- I think the results are bearing out. Clearly these markets that are not growing at the growth rate that this company is achieving so, we think we are in a unique position we have a -- our niche continues to expand we're looking at different opportunities in this regard. And I think having a strong balance sheet obviously positions us to take advantage of those opportunities. But as the same token we are trying to do things that don't require balance sheet I mean the Indianapolis business, we have very small investments in Indianapolis yet it's a major contributor today to our growth rate both sales and earnings and I signaled earlier about the moving from McLean Air Force base that also is a very minimal investment on our part, because we have a strong balance sheet, sometimes when you have a strong balance sheet you don't need to use it to go ahead and get some opportunities. So I think that's part of our strategy as well., We have a landing gear venture in Malaysia., That it is -- just coming into its own more or less. Not fully online it's more or less today -- more of a storefront that eventually will be a full-service repair facility. But no, other than that Stan at this moment, we do not have other physical -- facilities in that region. We do have sales offices throughout Asia that are managing the relationships with a different Asian account and but for the most part we're servicing those customers from our North American facilities., In time, we need to have more Asian consent -- more Asian mix in our business. And it's something we're focused on -- with the weak -- the flip side to a weak dollar is the inability to move into some of these markets advantageously. So for today at least we are able to get some growth servicing these businesses from North America. But long-term you're correct that company is going to need more capability in that region., Thank you., My sense is that with all of the stuff going on in the world today that lease rates will probably stay fairly steady to where they are today. Some of the opportunities that we have recently experienced are from aircraft where the leases -- are maybe three to five years old and they were rolling over and keep in mind five years ago a lease was in the depths of the kind of aerospace recession or whatever you want to call and lease rates were historically at very low levels. So you see in some reset in that regard coming out of that '03, '04 time period, maybe even '05 and as those mature and turnover I should say, the lease rates are more attractive., But I think from this point forward, I believe that the lease rates once they -- once you have come off the bottom of that period I just identified; I think the lease rates stay fairly constant. Now that's assuming that things stay relatively constant. So if things were to get worse again, and you would see a reduction in lease rates. But I think for right now, the world is in -- the aircrafts are in short supply worldwide at this point in time, and the more efficient the aircraft is, the more in demand the aircraft is. So we've been focused on more efficient aircraft and making sure that we can keep those aircraft out with good credits and so far we've been pretty successful in that regard., I think that pretty much says it., Yeah, I mean -- I think we haven't yet moved into the NG arena. We are looking today at opportunities in that market, but yes the A320 is something that we are trafficking in. And most of our activity has been in the 737 classic family, like for instance the acquisition of 18 aircraft from Malaysian Airline System, those were 737s, 400s that were 1992 to 1997 vintage aircraft. And so if you look at the majority of our portfolio would be in that vintage. Yet there is a movement for us, at least -- move that a little bit more current, if you will., I mean the average lease of -- the kinds of deals that we are entering are mostly in the three to five-year range, and we do -- from time-to-time, we are acquiring or we at least are looking at the aircraft that have longer lease periods, maybe coming off of some of the maybe -- 20-year, 25, 20-year leases, where we come in after the 50 year or something like that. So, but I would say generally speaking the lease rates for the aircraft that we're trafficking in are in the three to five-year range., Thank you., Thank you., Well, we have a leading position in this market. We've been in this business since our founding. So we understand the Aircraft parts market as well as anybody else in the business. We've been able to benefit from our strong balance sheet position. We talked about that in the second quarter and third -- second quarter in particular were we acquired a fair amount of inventory and that inventory is starting to flow through our system. We have meaningful sales coming out of the investments we made in the second quarter. We continue to make investments in the third quarter and we'll even continue to make investments in the fourth quarter in this business. So the -- I believe that we've been able to make pretty attractive acquisitions of equipment. And I think you're seeing some of that benefit there in the margin., So how long that sustains itself, is a tough question, we're very pleased with the performance of that group and that 24, you're correct is the upper end of the margins. There is still some elements of that business, our component repair shops for instance, can really see some -- there are opportunities there to improve our performance. We recently announced the contract for some more army helicopter component repair that should contribute to improve our margins in that business. But I think on balance, I think you pretty well said it, I think that we can fluctuate between that 22 and 24. We're running at the high-end, how long it stays at 24, I can't really say. I think the trend – I'm not seeing a change -- we haven't seen a change in trends but it doesn't mean that there can't be circumstances, situations that might cause that to dip down., Yes, I – listen, as we make these acquisitions there, there have been a little bit of drag on the margin so I -- as we try to normalize the business, in my opening comments that the sales growth was 39% if you back out the acquisitions. So, if you just looked organically sales growth was 25% and if you back out the year-over-year aircraft transactions sales growth was 19%. We reported 10.1% operating margins but you backed out the acquisitions and you backed out the aircraft transactions operating margins would have been 10.4%., So the acquisitions we've made have been a little bit of a drag on operating margins for some of the reasons that you identified. And overtime it would be our goal as we integrate these businesses; it will be our goal to see the operating these be -- contributors to our operating margin business. It might be a little tougher for the Avborne business because by nature the MRO business has tougher margins, operating margins – but also keep in mind, there is less investment in those businesses. So return on capital has been a better measurement for the MRO businesses, but nevertheless we would expect, Tim has numerous initiatives going on around the company. We have lean initiatives in our Indianapolis business and our landing gear business and our component shops in New York, and hopefully eventually in Amsterdam., So we're looking for ways to drive efficiency through the company. Going back to the performance goals of the company, we recognize that the growth that we gain today is largely we believe due to taking market share and we are taking that market share because we are performing. We're performing for the customer, but we also recognize need to perform for the shareholder. So in that process we hope to continue to down that path of getting to that 12.5% target. It will be iterate, it will be, goes into as and goes out as and as we absorb these acquisitions, at first flush they are a drag and then hopefully we're able to execute and get these -- the margins going in the right direction., No. There is nothing that is isolated on a quarter., So Eric, the lines that were going to go, were not coming out of Indy. The Southwest is a good customer and we are working with them everyway we can to support them. We've helped them get some of their aircraft back to service and we are constantly talking to them about ways to be more helpful., Correct., And as David mentioned, it's largely around the paper work., There is always a potential, but right now that's not the nature of the conversation we are having with United. So, we are prepared for that if that were to happen. But that's not what we're hearing., So David touched on it in his comments. We've got a good start and that we've won some businesses recently, some meaningful business and I think you probably saw that release., We've strengthened the leadership of that business recently that we think is also go into, going to have an impact. We're investing in some process improvement initiative there so, as David said I think there is still plenty of up side there, but we're, I think starting at the early stages of seeing some improvement., Yes., Eric, I'd say mid single digits or less. Okay., CapEx Eric is just under $8 million for the quarter., Thanks., Some, I'd say modest improvement. But, still I'd say -- I'd still say relatively tight., Well, it's not much around the wages, I wouldn't say. Wages have not come down, I think it's an industry-wide maybe even beyond industry-wide problem getting -- attracting skilled technical labor., I mean you certainly not unique to -- certainly not unique to Indianapolis., I think the integration has gone quite well. There has been some real solid positives that we've, that we've seen and really not any significant negatives., Troy, I would just add to that as David said it's a additional leg on the stool, so the level of integration, I think it's fair to say is a little lot lower than it would've been at Hot Springs acquisition., Yes., I mean -- those issues are well behind us. They -- I think they were a point in time a couple of quarters ago and we're not experiencing those difficulties with those aeroplanes., There is no -- no, there is no specific kind of contract renegotiations going on. As we look at Avborne and bring on new customers, but no. I don't think there is anything going on right now in terms of renegotiating any contracts., Tyler, it changes fairly frequently. But I think at last count we were booking out of eight bays., Okay. And we're getting ready to bring the paint bay on as well., Three., I didn't hear., The question is how many pre-9/11 aircraft are on the book. It's three., No auction rates notes., No exposure Arnie and what earnings on that cash -- somewhere between 300 and 375 deps., Arnie, we help Southwest in some of their outstations doing kind of remote overnight inspections. So, it didn't displace anything., It would not disrupt into our operations in any way., It looks like it's going to be early '09, Larry., When deliveries begin. We're continuing to work with our prime contractor and with Airbus to get the cargo systems design finalized and the manufacturing ramped up. So, it looks like it's going to be early '09, when it starts to impact revenues for us., Well, I think we'll provide different services for those aircraft. So it's possible that we'll provide repositioning services for the aircraft but most likely around component support and inventory support for those aircraft. But also think about also as possibly being a servicer of the aircraft – the whole aircraft itself through our aircraft sales and leasing subsidiary., I think our parts support business is a leading business in the world and I believe we'll capture our fair share of that business., Not – none of our active customers have approached us in that regard. And, Troy, keep in mind that in our supply chain business 35% of our business is to international carrier. So we haven't seen the same kind of discussion that you've seen here in the United States., Yes, like it's always been, it's going to be approached very opportunistically. So if the right opportunities come up, we'll be in a position to capture those opportunities, most likely in joint venture fashion as we've done over the past few years. But, so – as I sit here today, it's hard for me to predict what that might look like, but I think over 12-month period I think I wouldn't be surprised if you see some opportunities come our way., We saw that – we clearly saw better margins in our repair businesses in New York. We're still working on margin improvement in Europe. And I believe that we are in the supply-side, we continue to gain good positions, both in – through the acquisition of inventory as well as customer relationship. So you will have noted in the fourth quarter that our international business in the segment grew 15%. So I think the quality of our inventory, the quality of our relationships I think have improved and, we're – I can't say we're going to exactly hold to these margins because they are exceptional, but I think directionally you're going to see margins continue to be very strong in this piece of our business., We can get that, but keep in mind that we've had tremendous growth in Structures and Systems., We've had tremendous growth in MRO., And both of those businesses are less international by nature., And the MRO, we – our facilities are based here in North America and mostly – most of our customers I think we've communicated, 81% of our business if I am not mistaken, is domestic., And the structures business is largely DoD related. And so the – although we're getting good growth in the markets where we have a chance to get international business, as you look at it from a consolidated standpoint, you might not see the same dynamics., Larry, when we file our 10-K that international figures will be in there., Yeah. But I think to echo what David said, given the growth in two areas that don't have as much international exposure, I think, the enterprise number will be more flat., Sure Larry. The Avborne – the Avborne integration is going very well. They are very busy down there. It's – there is summer months that late summer gets a little slower and then picks back up in the fall, but we're very pleased, we already are seeing an international flavor to the customers that we have in there. So all in all, I think it's going very well., We're not doing any work for United right now. They're out of the facility., It's one bay – there is one bay available from our baseline and then there is additional capacity that we can have access to when we're in a position to take it on. But there are – replacing the three United lines with two additional lines has some near-term inefficiencies, but we're working through those and we expect to really be at – back at capacity here near-term., Yes., Well, from what prospective, I mean..., We are – Tyler it's pretty consistent with what we'd talked about earlier. The size of Avborne, we'd always said it's bit smaller than Indy. So it's a business that will be more in the 50 to $70 million a year range of revenue. And right now we're executing on that and you had a quarter's worth during the year. So you can do the math., Yeah, I'm sorry. I thought you just asked about Avborne. But yes, SUMMA was also part of the non-organic growth in the quarter., That's what we had talked about in the past, approximate size of SUMMA, right., Yes, that's correct., All in, Tyler. It's all in., Well, the – I guess our position in this regard, Tyler, is that, if you look at the results through May, we had solid results. The business continued through June at the same pace. We see lots of opportunities for the company and yet we don't fully have a grasp on the 135 to 145 a barrel and what that means on a sustained basis, as I indicated in my prepared comments. We have great positions on the defense as I've indicated. We feel really good about our supply chain businesses. And as I've indicated, we expect MRO to be up on a year-over-year basis. We prefer to stay away at this point in time from any forecasts. But as we sit here today we feel good about our positions and we feel good about our businesses., Yep., Good morning., Morning., J.B. we are very selective on the acquisitions that we are making to support these kind of asset categories, but there is still a significant number of shop visits for these – for the engines in particular, so it's not like we are completely out of these markets. So we are focused on our inventory turns, you heard David comment on our improvement year-over-year in inventory turns. We're focused on our whole period for the assets that we're acquiring, we are looking to reduce our exposure to certain asset categories and increase in others, but we are very focused on this, we are very opportunistic in terms of looking for the right ways to play it. And we're just factoring all these kind of moving pieces into our thinking as we acquire assets and of dispose assets., Absolutely. And in spite of the increase in the bad debt reserve there was did have a nice improvement in DSOs as a result of the focus on collection then on our exposures., It's a combination of things. So we started with our lean initiative across the different centers and that I think is starting to have an impact, we've got volumes up which is helping margins, we've got some diversification in MRO through engineering services, we're taking on more paintwork or looking to getting into seats and all of that I think is and will contribute to margins. Avborne is helpful. So I think it's a combination of factors., The vast majority of it is in the next 12 months., Yes, Stan. I think the keys to the achieving that goal are the sales growth, six underperforming companies, we had three underperforming companies at the start of the year, we now have two underperforming companies. Of those two, one will be greatly improved when we start delivering A400M systems. Another key element is driving down costs. We have a little blip in cost here this quarter, we got our arms around it at this point in time and hopefully get our SG&A back below our stated target of 10% and the income from JVs. So, a piece of that drives that 12.5% margin is to have a steady stream of income coming out of the JVs, we have been successful through the first three quarters of the year in making sales of aircraft in our JVs, and this quarter we did not have any. We do anticipate that we will have some of those sales in the next year, but I think when you add up those core elements, sales, fixing under performing, driving down costs, and income from JVs, that will drive us to our 12.5., The markets are in terms of growth – yes, we think there is growth potential out there, but we are driving the business more around some of the things I indicated before, taking market share and driving through execution and watching our balance sheet and generating cash and – until we understand what the 135 to 145 a barrel means, we want to keep our powder dry and that may cause the 12.5 target to take a little longer than we anticipated. But nevertheless that is what we are marching toward, the organization is focused on that. And we have a – throughout our businesses we have a clear understanding of the measures that we need to take and that is how we are managing our businesses., Yeah, these are all very important customers. One of those customers had filled some of that United States that we had talked about. We are working with all three of those customers to extend business. I think we have had some positive traction in that respect. So yes, those are – you have identified three very important customers for the company., Thank you., Hey, Eric., Hey, Eric., That's specific attribution, Eric., I think, Eric, I guess what we can say is that the growth – the contribution of our Defense businesses in fourth quarter was higher than the 37% we saw for the year. So we are about 39% for the fourth quarter showing that the trend is towards and the growth rate on the Military side was higher. I don't have the organic versus non-organic split for that in the latest quarter but or even for the year, but the Military side is clearly continuing to grow., No, there will be a good mix on the Composites, there will be a mix between Commercial as well as Defense and in that Commercial we will have some business jet work as well., Run rate in terms of -?, Yeah, I think it's a little bit too early at this point in time. Our plan is to have the combined business represent 100 million of revenues in a five-year period, three to five-year period, I mean three at the aggressive side and five at the more conservative side. But I think you can look at the similar dynamics of this business, so what we had in Indianapolis in MRO. So we exceeded our expectations in that business and it's possible to exceed our expectations in this business., Not really. I think market is still – the liquidity is still fairly tight, and I think it would be fairly consistent with liquidity in other industries at this moment as well. So I would say liquidity is – I wouldn't say seized up noticeably, I wouldn't say it's tightened any more noticeably. I think it's being fairly sized for a while here and I think that environment hasn't seen much change at this point., There's sufficient enough liquidity for the industry obviously to function. But there isn't – I would say the liquidity is tighter than you might otherwise want to see. But I think that's fairly consistent with what we signaled 90 days ago. We haven't seen a change necessarily in the last 90 days., That deal has not been finalized. The timeframe is still – let's call it uncertain. But let me just add that the deal flow in that market – in that business continues to be fairly strong. So we would anticipate the continuing growth rate in that business. And keep in mind that business has grown seven times in the last seven fiscal years., Thanks, Rich., Good morning., Okay. We have been through cycles before. So we had -- in the early '90s we experienced Pan AM, Eastern, Midway, TWA, Braniff, et cetera go out of business. We then had the crisis post 9/11, where 3,000 airplanes came out of the system in very short order. In both those cycles – subsequent to both those cycles or as those cycles recovered, the company found itself in much stronger positions in both cases. So going into the down cycle, let's say, of the early 90s we were approximately a 3 to $400 million company. We came out of the decade close to $1 billion company and in this decade – with this year just ended we are at – let's call it 1.4 billion. And earnings power is greater today than it has ever been in the company's history., So we have experience in dealing with these, let's call them, uncertain times. The major thrust of what we do is provide services to people who operate aircraft, in the case of the DoD not just aircraft but also ground equipment and other products for the Army. And the key to our company is staying close to our customer, understanding what it is our customer is looking for and then helping them solve their problems. So as long as aircrafts are operating, people are going to need inventory solutions, maintenance solutions and logistic solutions. And we have, I think, demonstrated our ability through a lot of focus on – Tim mentioned lean and I have mentioned execution over the years. And we focused on these things and adding engineering content to provide more value to our customers., So as our customers enter what they consider to be maybe tougher times, they are looking for companies like AAR to assist them as they need to navigate through these times. So when we look at inventory today, when we look at investments, we are really keeping a close eye or a very close communication with our customers, trying to anticipate together with the customers, what their requirements are and then making the investments in anticipation of these requirements. I think Tim alluded to inventory turns and working capital turns as part of my script. And the essence there is that when we are looking to make these investments let's look at getting our turns – let's look at the period of time that we can predict and let's go after those investments that we can get a fair return in that period of time. If the opportunity is of a riskier nature, I think we are taking the position today that we prefer to stay on the sidelines., So looking at the investments carefully, we are very focused on supporting our customers. I think the last question was around Defense, our Defense customers – and trying to get growth rates in our Defense area to be superior to our growth rate in the Commercial, because we do have a little bit more visibility, we do have solid positions in those markets. And we do anticipate continued strength in that arena. As it relates to generating cash, we are very – and the things that we are focused on at the company, I tried to communicate, Jon, that the key of the company is cash, cash generation, I mean if you look at the Aircraft Sales and Leasing business, for instance, we have not bought an aircraft for that segment since November of '07. And if you look at the cash we generated in the second half of the year, it's fairly significant, $66 million of cash, 44 coming in the fourth quarter., So the focus remains on generating cash from the businesses, maintaining a very strong balance sheet, so we can come out of this thing in a very solid fashion assuming that this thing is as tough as the last couple might have been although we don't yet have an indication if that be the case; focus on execution so we become more integral to our customer's operations, whether he be Defense or Commercial; and cost control, so to keep our SG&A under that 10% target; more engineering content, so we got the value chain for the customer, continue to explore and exploit niches so to find those areas that there are voids or the company through its capabilities can master that niche, Tim talked about engineering services in the aircraft maintenance arena, we talked about line services, paint, these are all newish kind of opportunities for the companies to explore., I signaled in my opening comments, the growth we've seen in our Mobility business for new products that we've developed in the last few years. So we are going to continue down that path and make solid prudent investments. Both continue to focus on process improvement, lean initiatives because you are seeing some of the benefits from that, those investments we have made in our MRO business and we expect some of that will bleed over to our defense manufacturing businesses as well., Well, I think that's a great question, my sense is if you look at the two fiscal years preceding this one for the airlines that are very profitable here in the United States. So it's hard to say, Jon, exactly how they will respond to oil going back down to $100 a barrel. I mean I think if you are flying commercially et al., which you will notice that most of these flights are, if not 85% full, at least 80% full, so even though loads have maybe come down slightly there's still at very historical high-level., So the idea that there is going to be – I don't know how many 11%, I heard it up to 15% of domestic capacity coming out, it's hard to envision what it's going to look like at the airport when people want to fly and there is no airplanes to take them. So I think that it's hard here to say how the U.S. carriers are going to – would respond to that. I would say internationally, it would speed up the pace of growth elsewhere if oil were to go down to that level. So I guess that's the best answer I can give at this point., Yep., It had nothing to do with Mesa, where Mesa is current on all their obligations to us., Yeah. I mean, in a general sense we are very – as you heard earlier, we are very focused on credit decisions right now and collections of amounts owed to us and as a result our DSO on our receivables is at the lowest it's ever been in the history of the company. So as a general rule, we have a lot of energy invested in that and are making sure we don't get over extended with any individual or more broadly have receivables outstanding longer than they ought to be, With respect to Mesa specifically, we are similar approach with them, we have worked very hard in conjunction with Mesa to restructure some of our agreements and to stay on top of our collections there to make sure that our risks there are as mitigated as possible., Yeah, it was a little over $8 million., I think on a quarterly basis, CapEx should be somewhere in the 8 to $10 million a quarter, probably., JV is about a third and balance sheet is about two-thirds., Yeah, the debt that we have brought in here is that we announced that we bought in June was debt that had – is a convertible debt where their shares have been in the share count. So in buying this debt at a discount, A, we get to reduce obligations, B, we get slight gains and, C, we eliminate – in the case of the acquisition we have made so far, we have eliminated 408,000 shares. So we are keeping an eye both. We are trying to figure out, as we generate cash, what's the best use of that cash might be. In the period – in June, we determined that buying in these converts was a pretty good use of cash as opposed to buying straight-up, the stock., Yeah, the shares are lower, I believe. And the bonds are lower., I think we're going to look at the cash generation from the company and make prudent decisions, as we've signaled, based on the cash position of the company., I think that's a constant item between us and the – and our airline customers. I don't think there is anything more unusual today than there has been. We are, as I indicated, we are very focused on taking market share. And the growth rates that we have experienced here in the last year exceeds any growth rate that the industry is forecasting. I think it exceeds growth rates of, if not every company, most of the companies in our industry., So we are very focused on execution, taking market share and obviously doing it at a profit. We also, as I signaled earlier, we are very focused on margins. So we want to do it all., And these are high-value solutions we provide for these carriers as well. So as long as we can continue to increase the value we provide, it's good for everybody., Thank you., I think that's a traditional response to these tougher times., The used overhaul parts business has been very strong. So we have no reason to believe at this point in time that it's – we have no signs yet that that business is slowing down. So yeah, I think we continue to do what we have been doing., Well, we are talking with people. We haven't necessarily lost the work yet in either facility. But we have – we do know of certain holes that we have that we didn't previously have. And we are in the process of filling those holes., Hey Troy, let's go back to MRO, what we are saying is we are going to have growth. We didn't put a number around teens or whatever, we just said that we are anticipating growth in the first quarter and in the year., On a year-over-year basis., We are not putting numbers out there. And I think the same in Supply Chain. We are going to keep executing and keep doing all the things we have been talking about., Yep., Those are all JV planes or – wait, three are JV planes..., Four are JV planes., Four are JV planes and one owned., Yeah, the first three roll over in the fall, the ones that we are looking to sell two and extend the lease on one. And the other two, one rolls in March '09 and one rolls in May '09., The sales would be in the second quarter., Second or possibly third quarter depending on time, but right on the bubble of second and third quarter., Yep., No, it's been a great workforce, Eric. The leadership team there is very connected to the floor. The turnover has been low so there is – that's not an issue., D&A was about 10 million, Eric. And I think that's probably a good run rate right now, as well., Nothing unusual. And as you indicated we had – we did repurchase some bonds. So you will see a little bit of benefit from that., Well, we didn't say it was one customer. In fact, it was not one customer, but it was specific – it was two different customers principally that it related to. To your question, I mean, cash and carry has always been a way of doing business. It's not a way we ever got out of entirely. But it's also not the preponderant way to do business. I mean, most of – our basic credit philosophy is that people who deserve credit get it, and those that we don't have a history with or haven't demonstrated the wherewithal to have credit, we don't give it to., Well, I think the core of your question, Eric, is really where does scale matter and where doesn't it matter?, And I think certainly our SG&A pool benefits as sales are higher and conversely as a percent of sales doesn't come off as linear as sales might. So you have a little bit I think of benefit there. I mean, you can look at history as to how our SG&A has been relative to sales to triangulate around that if you want to., I guess the other place that shows up slightly is in our Repair businesses. The Repair businesses tend to have a little bit of a fixed cost base to them. And so if volumes come down a little bit, you could have a little bit of margin degradation. And conversely, if volumes go up you can have some margin pickup. But I don't think that's as big an effect as the SG&A effect., Right, I think that's correct., Yeah, I think – we'll try to grab a number for you here quick, Larry. But I think your premise, though, is – you know, there are some regional carriers with some pretty deep pockets and arguably are in pretty good shape. So I don't think the hypothesis was exactly right. I would say, as a rough order of magnitude, our complete – our entire regional business is about 10% of the overall company. If you put it across all aspects of our regional – of where we touch regional carriers., Yes. Certainly, Mesa is a good chunk of that, right., Correct., Okay."
1004,2009.0,Q&A,a,"Hi, Larry., Hi, Larry. You know I think there is certainly opportunities out there. But the airlines are still being very cautious on their buying. So our approach is to go out there and look for new opportunities, penetrate the customers that we're doing business with already and see if we can find additional opportunities within that customer, and then obviously try and crack new customers. But no, I think the airlines are very cautious on their spending and very concerned about their traffic and still looking to take capacity out., Yes, Larry, I would just add that. I mean, load factors are hanging on, but you follow the airlines, their yields are under a lot of pressure, particularly from their premium cabins and that has – it's very clear evidence that they are very focused on liquidity, maintaining cash and minimizing spending. So there is a limit to how far they can mitigate spending obviously in this area, but clearly they're going to look to stay in that mode, I think for a while., That's correct., Yeah, landing gear had a strong Q4, yeah., Indy has been steady, doing a good job with its customer there. We've got some things in the works to bring additional work in there later in the summer or early in the fall. But they are doing a good job. Some of the investments in process improvement are starting to pay off. Our performance with our customer there has been excellent. So we're optimistic that we're going to be able to continue to attract business into SUMMA., We're still going through that conversation with our auditors, Larry. But, yeah, I mean, we're still moving in that direction., The significant agreement that we signed with a North American carrier supporting their fleet of regional aircraft, it's a – it looks like it's going to be a nice deal for the company. The customer was being under-supported by the previous contract holder and we were able to come in and kind of leverage our position that we already have in their – in that equipment type. And so far we're off to a good start. There was, as David said in his comments, a relatively modest upfront investment required. Looks like it's going to be a good program., No, it's not., We continue to work those possibilities., Yeah, Tyler, it was 4.1 million, which then brought our annual total to 27.5., I would expect CapEx to be in that same zip code probably. You may recall for '09, we had previously thought we'd be in a 30 to 40 million range. So obviously we came in just below the low end of that range. And I would expect to target the low end of that range again for fiscal '10., Tax rate, you should expect right around where you see the fourth quarter., Morning., It's all inventory., Yeah, that – those ratios have stayed pretty similar, J.B., Yeah, there was some seasonal – excuse me – some seasonal strength there. But having said that, the activity there is steady. So I think, while the fourth quarter is typically the strongest quarter in MRO, the activity level is decent., No, we don't., Hi, Eric., Hi, Eric., I think it's fairly stable. We don't see it getting any worse, we don't see any real uptick, if you will. So it feels like it's at a stable level. I mean, go back to what Rick said, at some point in time you're going to have – whether they're selling seats in the front cabin or not, they're going to have to start putting the engines through overhaul and spending money more on maintenance. So my sense is, they have a little bit more to work off yet. But I think when you get out of this summer, let's say, I think you'll start seeing an uptick in demand., Typically, yes., It's usually a function, Eric, of how interested the airlines are in capacity., And they're interested in reliability and capacity. They're going to have a lot more safety stock around., No, I mean we've talked about our spending across the company for several quarters here, it is something that we've been focused on internally. And we don't see any significant changes to that going forward., We will be spending a little bit money on AAR Global Solutions and it's going to take – there's a gestation period for those contract – A, for us to bid on the contracts and B, to win the contracts. Because there will be a period of time here over the next nine months or so where there will be a little bit of a drag on SG&A., Yeah, relatively modest., Yeah., In that zip code., Less than 8 million., Less than 8 million., Hey, Eric, I just want to remind you on SG&A. I mean there was nothing unusual in the fourth quarter, so it is representative of go-forward rate. But there is a little seasonality on that line, so just remember that., Right, that's correct., Yeah, you got a lot of moving pieces but just remember that it's not – you can't just straight line – or you won't just see a straight line number there is all I'm saying., Good morning, Tom., Yeah. Well, I think you're correct. Historically, this has been a major driver for our supply chain businesses and it'll continue to be so as time marches on. Right now, there is not a lot of movement in this regard. I think you're correct. We would anticipate it. You know, we have had some benefit in our MRO business of aircraft being repositioned, but mostly repositioned out of fleets as opposed to into new fleets. And we've had some pick up if you will in activity in support of aircraft that are moving. But as it relates to our spare parts business, at this stage I would say that again I think, as Rick said – I think that's going to be based on demand. There is some movements of aircraft. So it's not like it's come to a halt. It's just not as robust as we may have seen in the past. But I would anticipate that again once you come into the September time period, my sense is that you'll probably get a little pick up in aircraft movement., I think our relationships are very solid with the folks who have merged. And we continue to book a fair amount of business with those customers., It's an ongoing investment, yes. Our net investment didn't really change much, actually went down a little bit during the year because we were able to get some of our investments covered by the manufacturer. We intend to make a little more investment in that in fiscal '10., Thanks., That's correct, Jon., The aircraft in question here that we put on a lease is a 1997 aircraft. And we leased it at a lower rate than the prior lease but still at a acceptable return. On the seven aircraft that come off lease, those are 737 400s. I can't speak to the exact date but all of those aircrafts are 1992 to 1997 aircraft. They are all in pretty decent demand today and we anticipate that those aircraft will probably go back on lease with the current leaseholder and probably at a very similar rate to the rates that we've experienced before. We do also have one MV-80 lease in Europe that comes off lease and we're talking with the leasee there as well to potentially actually acquire that aircraft from us. That's one of our pre 9/11 aircraft and it has been written down fairly low and we'll convert that to cash most likely one way or the other this fiscal year., That's part of the seven. Six of them are the 737-400s – I'm sorry – and one is the MV-80, that's correct., Yeah, the accounting standard is going to require a restatement of all prior periods, Jon. So you'll always get apples and apples as we begin reporting that standard with first quarter of '10. And our projection is as – because of some of the repurchases that the impact is continuing to come down a little bit. Currently we're projecting it at approximately $0.09., That's correct., We're working on that activity right now, Jon, and depending on timelines we'll take that under advisement., See if it makes sense to do that., Thanks, Jon., Yeah, I think, Stan, at this stage, based on all the uncertainty in the capital markets, I think, yeah, that that would probably be the, watch our cash position and pay down our debt and particularly if we can bring our debt in at advantageous – on an advantageous basis., Yes, the accounting treatment may change. But, yes, it is still – from a balance sheet perspective and overall perspective, the answer is yes., I think in terms of large acquisitions, nothing necessarily on the radar screen. In terms of acquisitions that we can clearly fund out of our working capital position, the answer is probably more – more inclined to look at it that way., I think there is, in a general sense, on the first category with a larger deal I think it's kind of like the house market. You got buyers who want to pay a price and sellers want a different price. And I think in the lower-end market, there are a couple of situations that we might – that look interesting to us., Let me start by fiscal '09, Stan. So fourth quarter, we did 9.4 million, which brought the total for the year up to 40.6. I would expect fourth quarter to be pretty representative of what we would anticipate seeing next year., Yeah, fourth quarter was a little lower than you had seen the first three quarters. But if you take the fourth quarter and annualize that, that's what I would anticipate., Thanks., No. Nothing unusual. I mean, I think we've made comments Eric upfront about the macro environment I think puts visibility on the commercial markets that are close to an all-time low. I mean it's difficult to predict exactly what the carriers are going to do and what the slowdown from that will be. But I think we feel very good about our defense segments as we talked about. I think we feel good about the customer relationships we have. Nothing unusual in terms of SG&A or other types of controllable type of cost changes. So..., Basically that's a long-winded way of saying no., A significant difference in investment level. So this is less than a tenth of what we have invested – 10% of what we have invested in the Mesa deal., The answer is yes, because we are utilizing other people's inventory., We have a lease in/lease out construct with the person who owns the inventory, and we have an out out of that contract if the carrier were to struggle., Well, our bad debt provisioning that we took in Q4 would have been more in line with what we would consider to be normal, and therefore that's why it wasn't called out as opposed to some of the earlier quarters this year. I think the environment as we've talked about with respect to receivables, we have a very little concentration with respect to our receivables and we think that's fundamentally a very good thing. The dark side of that is you have a lot of small exposures and occasionally those flame out on you. So I think we'll have some of that to deal with, but nothing – we're not forecasting any kind of big hits right now., Yeah. I think we feel comfortable. The assets are all working, we're getting a decent return and we don't have any reason to expect anything otherwise at this stage., Recognize, Eric, as well, we're down to six aircraft in our owned portfolio. And those would be the only six that we directly hold on our balance sheet and have a disproportionate amount of capital tied up relative to the J.B. Aircraft., I don't know if we necessarily feel the effect of that. I mean, I think there's two sides to that for our company. One is it should create some reset opportunities for the company. On the other hand, there won't be as much requirement to bring things into that theater. But it seems to be, at least for now, at least that we're moving things into other theaters, which creates opportunities for this company., We actually are expecting an aircraft sale in the first quarter, and not that particular aircraft., But we are expecting an aircraft sale in the first quarter. That aircraft, if we sell, would be later in the fiscal year., I would say steady is probably the best description., Winglets – we're wrapping up the winglet program, but we're expecting a new winglet program to come in on its heels. We do have – we have been keeping seven or eight aircraft at Indianapolis and we see that continuing for the near future at least., No, I think the company, Tom, is a very different company than we were coming into that last period. On that last period, we had 72% of our business was aftermarket, today 47% into our aftermarket supply chain., And today the supply chain is 47% or in the 40 percentage of our business. We have before that time period, we had 1% of our revenue in Asia. Today, it's – I don't know if it's 5 or 7% but somewhere in that vicinity. We just have a more front-end business. So there has been a pretty – I think we've successfully diversified the mix of our business. If you take a look at the decline in the commercial arena, other than the quarters immediately post 9/11, having a 13% decline in our commercial markets is fairly meaningful, and yet I think the company is able to weather that through – by virtue of our diversification strategy., So yeah, it's a very different, Tom, I think it's a very different company. I think it's good that you raised this question, because I think many people still view us maybe from around the 9/11 time period. So I think you can see from these results, how much different the company is., Not really., No., Well, I think Larry the – just the volumes were lower in big ticket items, and at the component shops., And, the margin on big ticket items, it's volatile; sometimes they are modest, but other times they can be significant. So, I think you have just a – at least we experienced in the quarter, just a general softness in demand for parts and then it was exacerbated by the lack of any engines or large structural components., Larry, it's Rick. I'd just – I'd add to what Tim said on the also by pointing out that as part of what we described as some of the revenue weakness, which was really out of our component repair shops, those tend to be a little lower margin than the other aspects inside Supply Chain. So, you're getting a little bit of margin lift as those things show some softness., We're working it. We're working both the cost side and the business development side. We've got a team in there now working on improving the performance there, we've got some things that we're working on that are going to help. So, it's a priority., It got better actually. February was a strong month and we are seeing the volumes in March continue to track., It's fluctuating between seven and eight., Correct., But that includes some winglet work and things like that, that are -- produce less revenue than a solid maintenance line., But, the hanger count is not necessarily indicative of the activity level., 26 JV, Tyler, and 7 wholly owned., Tyler, we think that the impact on revenue was between 3 and $3.5 million. We expect to have that flow through relatively quickly, the rework that's being done is in process. So, I think we will be through the bulk of that in Q4 and in Q1. We think that the margin and the operating income impact is about a $1 million from – that came out of the third quarter that will go into Q4 and Q1., No, I think we have fairly decent visibility. We feel very good about our relationship with the customer we have today and, obviously we've been working diligently of late to replace the business that disappears as a result of grounding. And we have some stuff that we are working on, that we – we feel our capture rate – we have confidence in our ability to capture some of the stuff that we are looking at., We would anticipate that Indianapolis, a year from now will be in a stronger position then it is today., I don't know that for sure. I think there's changes in Southwest fleet planning as well. So, I wouldn't count on that., Hey, Eric., Good morning., I think it's a little too hard to predict, Eric, only as it relates to – try and understand what's happening to the fleets. I think if the fleets stabilized you are probably correct, but if the fleets continue to come down a little bit then you could have more of that effect going forward. But, our sense is that if you track the business on a weekly basis, obviously which we are doing, the business is showing some strength. So, their – demand seems to be stabilizing if you will, possibly increasing slightly., We clearly had a lull back in December and we've seen some pick up since then., It is on track., It is on track, Eric and it is, yes., The numbers are strong, the performance particularly at the mobility systems businesses is strong. We are continuing to add to the – win new business, at least. And we are doing a good job delivering against our backlog., Well no, I think there is going to be at least a modest uptick in revenue and the outlook continues to be good through our early fiscal 2011. So, we are encouraged., There's opportunities that we are working, clearly we are continuing to execute well on the programs that we have and we are looking to add to them., Right., We had a lease as we indicated that expires this quarter; the aircraft comes off lease in May and the aircraft is attractively priced, it's wholly owned by the company and the aircraft will go into disassembly, where we have demand for the parts for that aircraft. We have – other than that I don't believe we have any other aircraft that comes due this..., Fiscal year., This fiscal year, or..., Just the one, we do have some late during the calendar year., For the full fiscal year '10, I -- it's either six or seven re-pricing, they don't start till Q2 and they spread out to the balance of the year. So, I am just going off the top of my head here, but it's somewhere in the three to four range probably., Meaning leases coming to term., We have three wide bodies, we have two 767-300s on lease long-term with United., And we have one 747-400 leased with Northwest-Delta. We then have two A320s on lease. And we – I'm sorry, we have three A320s on lease. And then we have – the balance of the fleet would be 737-300s and 400s and one 737-500., Well, we do have – a couple of the airplanes are offered for sale, but at this moment we think we have a good position in the aircrafts. And we are deemphasizing because the capital markets are not extremely bullish in this kind of activity. So, we are not – we don't see the same opportunities; there is a huge spread between what buyers want to pay and what sellers think the assets are worth, and we see that continuing for a period of time., Well, I think clearly on the front end, where we haven't added an aircraft into our portfolio since November '07, so I think that the facts speaks for themselves in that regard, in terms of adding. And in terms of selling we have so--  we have been a seller of these aircrafts since then. We continue to operate the leases and look for opportunities to sell the assets. So, that would be the way I would characterize it., Yes., Hi, Tom., Well, the first part of the question Tom is we've expanded our product line quite dramatically. We made the acquisition of Brown Engineering a couple of years back and, year and half back or so, and Brown Engineering gets us into the command and communications world and environment. We think that world continues to show opportunities going forward., We feel good about the breadth of the product line today versus where it was in the past. We have capability where we are now – have these mobile shelters that are going on the back of the trucks and things of that nature. We are getting a lot better at stuffing the shelters than we were in the past., So, yes, I think the product line is definitely broader than it was in the past, and I think as it relates to moving forward, as I said in my opening comments we feel very good about the balance to our portfolio that we have today. And historically when the commercial airline business has been a little softer that business has been a little stronger and vice-versa to some extent as well. So, I think that the story is around how we are faring through this downturn versus how we fared through previous downturns, which you have been..., With us through and..., I think that there's --I think we are in a good position in that business. I don't see world tensions diminishing in an appreciable fashion, they may move from theater to theater, but clearly the U.S.'s capability of moving into different theaters becomes more pressing. And one theater that's developing quite frankly for the company is the southwest United States, and so there's -- I think broad range of applications for our products today, as the product continues to broaden itself., I think it's also a resource allocation for AAR; we see greater opportunities elsewhere., And, we feel really good about our position in the other three markets, and this market we've always been just a dabbler in that market, and I think it's time for us at least to dabble a little bit less., Yes, Tom from time to time we are getting phone calls from capital market folks who are representing people who have bonds that they'd like to liquify. So, that has not diminished, and I can't really tell you what that's going to look like 90 days from now, but as we sit here today there is still – those opportunities still do exist for the company., Yes., Morning., No, you saw the full brunt within the quarter., Absolutely. We could have done a better job here and we've – lesson learned if you will, a tough lesson, a hard lesson, and shame on us to some extent. But yes, definitely, we're much more cognizant, it was an unfortunate wake up call in this context. But, keep in mind now, safety of flight was never an issue, quality was never an issue, more about relationship management more than anything else, and yes, we can do a better job in our relationship management., And I have, since this event I have held meetings with the senior people from the flight, Safety and Flight Standards group within the FAA in Washington D.C. and I will be meeting on one-on-one basis with the head of the Miami FSDO on April 6. So, yes, clearly we could have been done a better job at the front end here., I don't know, I won't necessarily characterize it that way but I would say that the local –  those are powerful in and of themselves and need to be reckoned with in there – on the locale in which they are operating. But yeah, I mean in this case here, we've been in the Miami operation now since late 80s. We've had relationships where we let the relationships – to my interpretation is that we let the relationship get away from us. And we have to do a better job on the front end in that relationship aspect., Yeah. But you should know also that the FAA holds the company in very high regard and that was..., That's what was conveyed to me when I was in DC. And like I say – I just want to reiterate it, this was never a safety of flight issue, never a quality issue. And as you can tell the parts have not been recalled or anything of that nature, so, okay?, Okay. All right., I think if you looked historically, J.B., you would see that this quarter's performance is sort of more in line with what you would have – what would you've seen as trend line. We've been ratcheting up the margin in this area but somewhere in the 15% or just under is more in line with what you have seen historically. So last quarter's was a little bit of an aberration and it was product mix oriented., Sorry, which number?, Gross profit or --, Yes it's really just – it's just lease revenue. That tends to be a very high margin area when you have very little revenue. So in the past if you look back when we sell an aircraft from our own portfolio you have more sales and then you start to actually have a slightly lower margin. But the lease revenue on – which doesn't show up as a – it tends to be a very margin area, J.B. So I think it's just a kind of a law of small numbers there., We didn't, but I'm happy to share that with you. It's 9.7 million for the quarter., Henry, the comment – just to be clear, the comment up front was that we had made acquisitions and targeted some of our organic growth in a it's also policy balance in the enterprise. So going backwards there was an effort to get more defense exposure, little more front-end content exposure. And that's where we had been emphasizing., As we look ahead, we continue to see organic investment opportunities as well as acquisition opportunities are all ways of – for us, of using some of the cash we generate. I don't know that we have a specific priority right now, but we are interested in serving both major customer segments. And we are interested in continuing to serve them both with front-end content as well as after-market services. So I think all of the above are in solution side for us., No, I would say there was concern obviously around the disruption as we were going through it. But we tried to keep the customers as current as we could in terms of what was happening. Since it's been resolved, we've been visited by all of our customers basically. And I would say that there is no backlash if you will, in terms of gear coming into the facility for repair., That's right, and we're working hard to make sure that that doesn't happen., We do Landing Gear for Southwest, yes., No, I'm sure that that's correct., In absolute dollars, Larry, that's – you're correct in your assessment. And yeah, I mean we're very focused on managing SG&A. Very focused, given the environment., They're both busy., Stan, first of all, hello., It's been awhile. Okay, good morning. I think it's around balance. It's clearly looking for – our first use of cash is to – it's all around yield and return on capital. So wherever we feel we can get the best return for our capital. Right now, if you look at the quarter that just ended, we felt very good about putting some capital to work, taking advantage of some buying opportunities., And we put some capital to work on investment in longer-lived assets. We, for instance, acquired a shipset of 777 landing gear for approximately $8 million from Delta Air Lines, and secured a multi-year contract from them as a result of putting that capital to work. We also acquired some bonds that we felt were attractively priced. As you can see, we have a 9% yield. Our cost of incremental capital is – incremental dollars is – it's a real positive arbitrage for us, let me put it that way. So, yeah, I think it's a balance. We are constantly looking for ways to maximize the dollars that we put to work., Yeah, I would say that if we were to do an acquisition, it would be obviously accretive, first of all. Secondly, I think we'd be looking for a way to finance it that would be appropriate. But at this moment, we have a couple of minor situations that we're looking at, and – in the overall scheme of things. And yeah, so I think the opportunity would have to be a good opportunity that made sense for our portfolio., Yes., Yeah, yes, correct., And it's hard, but yeah, that's -, Keep in mind, Stan also, vis a vis strategy to get the margins from 10 to 12.5, for instance, is around the Aircraft Sales and Leasing portfolio. So we are going to be diminishing that. And that will have a – create a little bit more pressure on bringing the margins up in the short-term., That's correct., Yes, that's correct., Yes. Thank you very much., Avborne, we talked in the past, Eric, about the size of Avborne and so just to reiterate that – that's somewhere between 10 and $15 million per quarter, okay. So I won't get any more specific than that, but you can kind of play around with the numbers based on that information., The EPS impact will be much more modest, so that's why we're not really talking about an EPS level. We have a pretty good natural hedge to the operation. But on the top line, you see the impact., It was in the neighborhood of a couple million dollars, Eric., Just under 7 million. 6.8., On composites, the Sacramento facility is up and running, looking for more work, but nonetheless operating. In terms of SUMMA, the volumes continue to be strong there. We are looking – I'm actually going to be visiting there this afternoon. We are encouraged by some of the prospects we have down there. We do have some work to do on some particular programs. But we'll work on those or work through them. So I think on balance I think we feel good about what's going on down at SUMMA., No, it's still small. But it positions us very nicely as the demand for composite materials increases. So it's a great facility with tremendous capability that puts us in a nice place in a market that we see as really taking off here in the next 3 to 5 years., Well, we're looking at for the composite business in total, is 100 million, for the two businesses., We are doing today roughly, what, 35? approximately 35 today. And we are looking to get to 100 in 5 years. That's been our plan. Now we have two – if you look at the operation now in Sacramento, we have two very large defense oriented contracts that are being worked at this time, and too hard to handicap whether we will be successful or not, but if we are, we'll get that target quicker. Sooner rather than later., Yeah, I mean, J.B., we monitor that closely by looking at turns data. And we also do look at aging data of our inventory. And our – we haven't seen any fallback in our major metrics there. And so, in particular, aging, more than about 85% of that inventory balance has been acquired within the last – is less than 18 months old. And so we feel pretty good about our carrying values in that product., Hey, Tyler., It's mix. We're also getting a decent operating leverage out of the mobility business. We've talked to you before at pretty good length about some of the lean initiatives that we have going on across the company and the Structures and Systems group was really at the forefront of that. So I think we are benefiting from some of that. We took on this additional capacity down in Goldsboro, which is fully engaged now and at full production. So that's giving us a little bit of help there as a lower cost manufacturing center. So I think it's a combination of product mix in addition to some of the things that we've done internally to become as efficient as we can., I mean, I think you could see some variability, Tyler, but I think all in all we expect our margins in this segment to be – continue to be respectable., Tyler, this is Rick, I will just add in, I mean, we've seen spikes in the past as you know quarter-to-quarter and that really our product mix and I think you're seeing that a little bit now. I mean, our long-term trend rate has clearly gone up for the reasons Tim just talked about, but you shouldn't fixate on this quarter as your go-forward number, I don't think., Global Solutions is up in our SG&A numbers, Tyler, and what you see is the JV earnings line, it's still purely aircraft., The other impact from Global Solutions is way down at the bottom of the P&L. And you see that line, the portion that we do not own is the line called – it's called the Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest. So, that's where you back out the piece of Global Solutions that we don't own., But otherwise the line item called JV is still purely , Our expectations for profits in the JVs?, We – well, let's reflect about some – a little bit of new lease rates, but we've also ratcheted up our depreciation rates on that, Tyler, given the environment we're in; we're depreciating some of the aircrafts quicker and that's why you're seeing a reduction in some of the operating earnings., Hi, Eric., There were no one-time write-downs and there were also obviously no aircrafts sold out of the JV either. So this is a pure just 'manage the portfolio' outcome and as I said Eric, we're depreciating the aircraft a little quicker than we originally had. So the rate you see here in the first quarter is probably a pretty good predictor of what to expect, going forward., Yes. I think we've seen it in supply chain and we see it in MRO., I think you'll see it in top line. I think you'll see some improvement top line and hopefully we'll get some improvement in margin as well as we get additional top line., Eric, it's particularly in supply chain, what we did in response to a very weak demand environment in Q1 was, because of our focus on cash, as we – we participated in a weak market by being a little more aggressive on the pricing side. As we see the market firming up, we think that should help bolster margins as well., Well, we gained strength in – clear strength in mobility. We have good performance coming out of SUMMA, Composites is a little softer than we'd like to see, and Cargo Systems has been holding on its – holding its own. Cargo Systems is still very focused around the A400M. And so yes, I'd say that'd be the characterization I'd have for those businesses., Yes., Okay, Stan, I think as we've been doing over the last, say, 12 months or 14 months, I think we're very focused on buying it advantageously. So we're not aggressively out in that market. We're responding to opportunities. So we the get phone calls and if the pricing looks good we've been taking advantage of it. We're looking at what we're focused on, the yield, and we've been shooting for – we've been consistently in the nine to higher percent yield on our buybacks. So that's what we're looking at., It might slow us down, it might slow us down., Yes., Yes. So to be clear just on that point Stan, the aircraft and the JVs, all that depreciation just flows through the JV line, so you don't actually see that in our depreciation and amortization number. But to answer your question on our current rate, for Q1 we had $8.7 million of depreciation and amortization. In addition Stan you may also be interested in because of a new accounting standard related to our convertible debt, we now have to book interest – non-cash interest expense. So it's effectively interest expense that's above and beyond the coupon we actually pay, and that was $2.9 million during the quarter as well., Yeah, right now, that's our expectation., Thanks., Good morning., Supply chain has seen some nice improvement over comparable periods in Q1 and MRO, we're optimistic that this will be a better quarter than prior quarters. So, that business is a little hard to look at a three-week period., The supply chain business, we can look at specific data, three weeks over three weeks and it's very favorable at this stage., There's been some pricing pressure and I think you saw some of that in the margins. We maintain – our top priority at this stage continues to be manage the business around cash and generate cash; we are less focused on margin, but we are – we would expect the margins to strengthen as the environment improves and yeah, as time marches on. So I think – I would hope that we hit a low point in supply chain margins in Q1, and that margins will – you will see an uptick to margins as we get into Q2, three and four., It's filled up for the most part – we're strong as we've discussed before with Southwest, we took on this recent win with Continental, and we do have some space availability. But for the most part, we're in pretty good shape there., You mean from last year, you're talking?, Q1 last year, we still had the benefits of having United and FedEx in our shop. So we were a little bit more loaded there. So that work came out, I think, Q2 last year, if I'm not mistaken. So the comp gets a little bit more favorable on that part, but we also had some falloff in our Miami operation and Oklahoma City. So we've had Indy has maintained itself, let's say, other than those, the United and FedEx aircraft at OKC and Miami have been a little bit down on a year-over-year basis., Yeah. It's one of these things, J.B., where you have to accrete the debt back up to its par value over time. And you do it on a constant yield basis. So the absolute dollar amount may change. But we'll try to give you guys a little better guidance on that. But right now 2.9 is what you should think about for the near term on a quarterly basis., For interest expenses for GAAP purposes. Yeah. Yeah., Okay., No, what we're saying is we have seven aircrafts where the lease expires this fiscal year, and we expect to release all seven of those aircrafts to the current lessees., 31, five that are owned on our balance sheet and 26 through joint ventures., Yeah. What we're going to do is, we're going to put that in the 10-Q that we'll be filing on Friday. We'll have a complete description of each aircraft that we have and the lease term and what our expectation – what we expect to happen at lease expiration. But basically we have a – the fleet is 737-400, largely 737-400s. They make up about 18 or 19 of the aircraft. We have one 747-400, we have two 767-300s, and we have one MD-83, and we have two A-320s, that's roughly. And we have one CRJ 200., I think I've just covered all 31., We may have to re-lease them at slightly lower rates. But for those six that we're talking about, those lease rates should be – well, some of them we're talking about those lease rates should be fairly constant with what we've been experiencing., Yeah, absolutely. We were – that program was supposed to be live by now. We would have been expecting shipments but it's been delayed, and we received some encouragement at least that the – there is a date for a flight test and hopefully that goes well and hopefully we can get back on – get a firm schedule from Airbus sooner rather than later., Jim, just to be clear, that's obviously not in any numbers currently or any historic numbers., So that sounds like our backlog – it doesn't factor in our backlog, it's – right, we're – it's not in our – we haven't had any shipments, and we don't have anything forecasted in our backlog., I would anticipate, we have one – we have pre-sold one of our aircrafts. We have one aircraft that's on lease with U.S. Air that we have pre-sold. I believe we sell that in fiscal year '11., And that's the – on this aircraft sale that we just had this past quarter, we had been working on for some time. This had been a leverage lease, with Continental airlines. They were looking to get out of the fleet type, and they were able to actually sell the aircraft on our behalf into Russia., And it's hard for me to say at this point, Jon, what the deal flow looks like from a sale vantage point between now and the end of fiscal year. We don't expect any real changes, let's say, but there could be opportunistic situations, particularly on the A320s to sell maybe one of those aircrafts., All of the 737s Jon, and many of the older generation aircrafts., With respect to the -, Yeah, for the convertible debt., Yes, Jon, we're going to put that into the 10-Q., Yeah, the only caveat on that Jon, or where it gets a little complicated, is when you buy back some of the debt, the impact changes because we don't recognize any longer the same kind of economic gain in the P&L the way we used to. So if I can just say to you that if you assume for a moment we did not buy back any more debt, then the answer is, it will be at the lower end of that range., You saw us talk about it being $0.02 this quarter, we probably expect that to be the quarterly impact for the rest of the year., We bought 12.5 core value of our converted back., You're welcome., Hey, Tom., Yeah, we've had that capability for – this will be – not be the first work of this type. We performed winglet work for Continental before on 737s, and we've performed winglet work for Southwest on 737s, both in Miami and in Indianapolis., I think in both cases, I think correct in both, but the impetus on the merchandising side is really with Boeing and Boeing partners., Obviously, they have the – they control the technology and it's a function, I think, of how many of these – of these winglet kits they can produce in a period of time. So, so far they've had some pretty good success, the numbers look fairly compelling from an investor vantage point. So I think Continental took advantage of a good opportunity with a good payback and I'm sure other carriers are looking at the same, I think it's a function to some extent as to how quickly aviation partners can deliver kits., Yeah., I think there are two factors that we've kind of considered here, one is the overall fleet size itself and the impact on the possibility that there'll be continual reduction in fleet size. But the other side of the coin, which I think we're – in terms of dialogue we've been having with customers is the amount of deferral if you will in terms of work being performed on the – and particularly on engines., So I think the carriers are looking at – they've been depleting the serviceable stockpile if you will and we have a fairly high level of confidence that that can only go on for so long. And we expect – that's why we're pointing towards the January timeframe as a period for a more robust environment. But keep in mind I think the first part of that equation weighs on us a little bit in terms of what does the overall economic picture look like and therefore what does the fleet size look like and obviously our business is pegged to some extent on aircraft and service., Well, I believe that would be a positive. I think at this point in time we are selling more into the pipeline than we are into going right into theaters. So I believe most of the in-theater equipment has already been procured and has been – and is performing its task and then clearly the – if you are sitting there in the Pentagon today, you are not just focused on Afghanistan and Iraq, but you're also looking around the world, and Somalia and some other interesting places and maybe worried about Iran to some extent, maybe even worried about North Korea., So I think the supply chain needs to be filled out if you will to allow for the possibility of quick movement into other theaters. So the visibility we have is – leads us to believe that there will continue to be demand for the things that we're doing., We don't have a direct benefit to that at this point that we see, but I would – there's other pieces of our business that do benefit as equipment gets reset. We will be in the position to provide some service work and things of that nature through our repair and supply chain businesses., Well I, the – we're currently not receiving any revenue from that business. So we started that business in the middle of June and we've had a ramp up if you will in terms of bidding on different programs. The real expense comes in when we pull the team together to bid on these contracts., We have – there's a lot of action going on in that business, so the bidding expense is not going to decline – is not going to decline too much, but at some point in time we're going to win some business. So when we win some business, the – I would – we would expect that the business will have more income than expense obviously, more gross margin than expense and be profitable here hopefully in the near term. Near-term being towards the end of our fiscal year., So the – we will – we're managing our costs, watching it closely, but at the same token to get our name out, to get into this market, you've got to bid on contracts and the bidding process has a cost associated with it., Yeah, I think the 2.4 is a little bit steeper than we should expect in Q's two, three and four, but not way out from what we might expect., Yeah. But, Troy, I think of it as a development stage business for the next two quarters probably, and then it transitions to more of an operating enterprise at that point., So, there were no write-downs, Troy, it's – you are never done looking at all that stuff. So we'll always be looking at our inventory, make sure we feel good about it. We didn't have any write-downs this quarter. We felt good about monetizing some of the inventory we had and reducing some of our balances, our terms have held up. So, yeah, we feel pretty good about our inventory position right now., Well, the agreement itself doesn't call for expansion, Larry, but we're optimistic that having Continental aircraft in there and performing well for them will get them familiar with the facility, familiar with our work and bring them on as a long-term customer., Yeah, what we're – what you want to do is get some color from our group operating leaders, how they see their businesses, and what kind of exciting things they have going on a little deeper inside of each one of the segments., Let me stay away from size, but I think in terms of the general areas, we see some opportunities in that defense arena, and they look – defense and government service arena I should say, they look pretty interesting for us. And, since we've been in the Global Solutions environment, we have seen opportunities that we had not seen before coming through to the company and some of which look rather interesting for the company., So I think that's an area that looks very interesting and at the same token in conversation with certain of our commercial airline customers, there are some targeted areas of opportunity that we are exploring., Yes. But specific – very targeted on the inventory, and yes, acquisitions on the – as I talked about the defense and government service business., Eric, CapEx for the quarter was 8.9 million and if you annualize that, that obviously gets you right around 35 to 40 and that's about consistent with what our expectations are., We've been working on Continental, and I think the relationship that Avborne had with them did help, but Continental has been a target for us. We'd like to do more work with them, not just on MRO but across the company., Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely., Thank you., We think that the work that we've won will offset the decline, Troy. There's been a fair amount of bid activity. We've been successful in landing several new awards. And yes, we did have a couple of fairly significant programs roll off. But the short answer is, no, we expect that the new business to offset the business that's gone away., That's what we're seeing. That's our expectation is – come January that we expect a pick up. Rick, you might want to add some to that?, Yes. Troy, I will just remind you, I mean, I think we've been saying for a while we think after the turn of the New Year, we would begin to see more of that behavior kicking in. When you line that up with our fiscal third quarter, recognize our third quarter is already a third down when you get to the beginning of the New Year. So how much impact we'll see in the third quarter, I think, remains to be seen a little bit. But we do see – we do continue to believe the trends will improve as we get into the New Year., In what aspect of the -, Well, I think as you've heard here, we've secured some very important wins during the quarter, some – most of which contribute to the back half of the year. And when you look at that and then you think about improving trends, which we think we'll – continue to happen in the commercial markets, I think you can draw your own conclusion from that., Good morning., Hey, Eric., For the most part, it's market share gains, Eric. There's still – we're still seeing lower shop inputs from sort of the core customer base. So I would say that this is more share gain than kind of fleet – new fleet inputs., No, it's spread around., It's equipment that we have a lot of experience in, but as we've talked in the past, the pricing environment is very tight., You still have to characterize the industry as having overcapacity at this time on the maintenance side., I don't think so, no, we're not expecting that. We're expecting actually as we get more volume, hopefully the margins improve., So your question Larry. I think just to be clear is really a commentary on the supply chain segment mostly., Yeah, I mean, we're quite obviously pleased to see the improvements sequentially. I mean, that was about 250 basis points of improvement if you normalize the first quarter for the aircraft transaction that we had. And so you're still at 250 basis points. That's still not back to where we had gotten accustomed to the same margins there and so I think that's indicative of you're not seeing the market rebound entirely. We also are – we also don't have the volume there that we would have, we would typically expect either and as volume improves that ought to be contributory towards margins as well. So, I think it's a same story it's come back a bit but we would hope that there's more to come as both volumes and demand environment improves., When it starts up, it will probably need a little bit of time to get to its full run rate margin. So, we may see a little degradation in the beginning. But as we ramp up to that over a couple of quarters, we would expect that to – we wouldn't expect it to be dilutive to the overall segment., Yeah. I think the structural changes, David commented on regarding our North Carolina facility and some of the machining and sourcing we've done, our – again,  our structural changes, that should be sustainable. Some of the product mix comments and some of the volume comments will change. So, you had all of that contributing to what was very stellar second quarter margin performance in the segment. Some of that we think is permanent, some of it probably not., Good morning., Yeah, we have a few major awards out there. And we have a series of smaller programs that we're bidding on. So, it's a good mix. I'd still hold to our original premise, that will take nine to 12 months to see revenue coming from this business, and we started back middle of June, first of July. So, I still think we're expecting the flow of business to hit later as this – as we move into the middle of the next calendar year., And we can get pleasant surprise. I mean, there's one bid in particular comes that's due – the announcement is due before the – at this moment at least it's due before the end of this calendar year. But we are seeing influx of activity, particularly around Afghanistan, that's kicked in since the President's announcement., Well, it's a hard one to answer on, because it's – we're trying to get a sense right now to what those current supply chain looks like inside the DoD, and we're in the process of accumulating that data. But what we have seen is, as we've moved into different theaters over time, the needs inside the theater have changed and evolved. And one of the reasons we've been able to do so well is we've been able continue to upgrade our product offering, increase our product offering to meet the surging demand and changing demand. So we would anticipate there'll be some of that as they get in more entrenched into Afghanistan., Yes, the Sikorsky win is a composite win, and we will – we have another business win that we should be announcing here shortly that's also for our composite business. So we are seeing some traction. And it's – obviously, when we set out with the growth plan that we had, of course, we hadn't seen, necessarily, the fall-off in the economy that we've experienced. So although we saw that growth targets probably pushed out a couple years. But nevertheless, we have had a – two meaningful wins here in the real short-term., 35 to 40 million – 30 to 40 million, in that range., Yes. We expect to see some action coming out of Afghanistan, yes, that's correct., It flew on Friday at 10:15 a.m. Paris time., Get funded., What we've – what we understand, in terms of a decision point, and this is what we've actually read in the press. We don't know this in any private negotiations – discussions of any sort, but in terms of public message is that the decision will be made by January 31, '010. So we're looking at approximately 45 days from now., And Jon, in terms of second part of your question, what's capitalized on our balance sheet has been in our SEC filings for a while, but just to remind everybody, it was $45 million., So far, Stan, what we've been doing is paying down debt, continue to pay down debt. Our net debt today is somewhere in the vicinity of about 200 to 220 million., Yeah. Face value --, Yeah., Is just under 300 million. Just under 300 of net debt., Net debt., Well, it depends on how much cash we continue to generate. And I don't want to necessarily make a decision on that at this moment or make a – or communicate what our plan will be at this moment. It depends on how much more cash we continue to generate., We don't see that, no., Yeah., Yeah, I think we feel good about our cash – our ability to generate cash. You've seen we've done a pretty good job in that regard. And we – our plan is to continue at that pace., Yeah, gross profit in the one segment I'm referring to, and that's in the Structures and Systems segment, where we had extraordinarily high margins this quarter. And it's not accidental. We've taken steps to grow those margins and we would anticipate that the margins will continue to be strong. But there might be some mix implications that would cause those margins come to off that peak, but still be running at a pretty good healthy rate. And I think as we get volumes in the commercial parts of our business, we'd expect margins to strengthen., Continues to perform. Principal customer there is Southwest. We are getting work from Continental there as well. We are competing for work from other carriers for the plant and we're holding our own., We'll have a relatively – it's on a relatively small investment; so our return on investment continues to be acceptable., Thank you., Good morning., Good morning., Correct., Thanks, John., Yeah, the margins we saw in the second quarter, Troy, are still both – in supply chain, are still below what you would see as kind of a historical average if you look back over the last eight to 10 quarters. So what I think our comment was, was we had hit a real – what we hope was a low watermark in first quarter. We had nice sequential improvement in second quarter, but where we find ourselves is still below the norm we've gotten accustomed to. And so, we believe with the return of demand and volume – which will translate to obviously volume – and will also translate to a better spot market pricing environment, we think there's more room to go there., When it's fully operational, Troy – we're fully operational and we've gotten all aspects of it and we'd hope that to be pretty consistent with the segment margins., And we expect to be fully operational by Q4., We continue to work it. No real updates at this point. We did win some F-35 business in the quarter. But relatively small, and it was the metal work that we won., One-off being very opportunistic., Five owned outright, 27 with the inclusion of this aircraft owned through – with partners., Yeah, the contract we won is to provide lift for a group of geologists. They're going into the territories to look for mineral composition in the soil, and we have contracted with a local Afghan partner to provide the lift. And so we have a contract to assure that that lift is handled properly. And we have executed, again, some of the contract and we expect more of that work to continue., I believe, yeah, that's clearly the way to look at it. And it's a small start, but it is at least a start., No, no. It's not going go to 600, it's going to go down., Okay., Yeah. So two – I think there's two parts to your question, J.B. The first is when revenue starts to get recognized or realized in Global Solutions, it will roll into the supply chain, at least as we've currently structured our segments. So you would expect it to see there. The commentary on the cost that is in our SG&A numbers so, as that comes down, you'll see SG&A come down., I didn't. Actually, it was 8.8 million., Absolutely, it can be. But more to your – quite to the heart of your question, let's just be clear on our comments. Supply chain had – excuse me. Structures and Systems segment was – segment margin was extremely strong this quarter and you've heard us say, we don't think it's going to stay at that level permanently and it'll come down a bit. But I'd also – you're not hearing us say, it's going to come down, fall off a cliff. So, we think it will kind of come down a bit. You're also hearing us talk about new wins, Eric, and you're also hearing us talk about as we get into the New Year, an expectation of demand improvement in the commercial markets. So you can net all that out in your own mind, but I mean to your – is it possible for sequential improvement, certainly., Yeah, Eric this is Tim. Yeah, what I'm looking for is modest sequential improvement in Q3. There's still some variables, but that's what we're looking for. We're looking for a better quarter in MRO and we're looking for a better quarter in supply chain., Yeah, it's coming down. But it's not falling off a cliff, Eric. I mean they are – it's well publicized that Mesa is not renewing its business with United Airlines, at least with its 50 seat aircraft. And therefore they will be moving 50-seat aircraft out of their fleet. Whether they redeploy those or not, I think remains to be seen. But as those come out we will see that come out of some of our supply chain performance. But it's not – having said all that, we're not expecting, in Q3 or Q4 to have dramatic changes to our – from that., We do a lot of work for Mesa. As you know from our public filings, we do about $70 million of revenue for them. That is split across 50 seat aircraft as well as 70 and 90 seat aircraft. And as we also pointed out in our public filings, so the 50 seat business is about half of that total, $35 million. And that in turn is split again between CRJ 200 and ERJ 145 work. The kind of business that Mesa was doing for United is strictly CRJ 200. It's ERJ 145 work is still under contract for a longer term with Delta Air Lines., So you're talking about a relatively small subset of their overall scope of what we do with them, which is being impacted by this. And so when you whittle that down, yes, we will see that impact. But when you put that in the context of all the other things we've talked about today, with some new business wins etcetera. I don't think you're going to see – you're not going to see that trickle. You're not going to see that kind of filter through all that., Well, as David mentioned that the deal flow has been strong. And you'll see us coming out with some fairly significant announcements here and there is deals behind the ones that we're landing today. So, Eric, we feel pretty good about the, about the deal flow here in the near-term., No, Eric. I think you're the first to ask. The CapEx for the quarter was pretty modest, it was $6 million, brings our six month total to 15 million. And that's pretty consistent with what I think we've been expecting all year, which is about, roughly $30 million of CapEx for the year., Thank you."
1004,2010.0,Q&A,a,"Hi, Joe., Yeah, well, Joe, I don't know, let me go over. I may – we went into a fair amount of detail. I don't know if you got to hear all of my prepared comments, but I mean there were really three drivers to that decline sequentially in margin, okay? The first was related to KC-10 program, we had some transition costs that we continued to incur to deliver the performance that the customer needs. We remain confident we'll work through those increased costs as the year progresses. So we see that as an impact, but one that should be temporary., The second area, which I mentioned, is we did have a pricing adjustment on one of our Supply Chain Logistics programs, so not related to AWS, but one of our other Supply Logistics programs besides the KC-10. There was a scheduled pricing adjustment. It's a very long-term contract, and it's not unusual to have some provisions in some of these longer-term contracts where we readdress price. It kind of protects both parties. So that was a scheduled event that occurred and that results in a little bit of an unfavorable margin impact to us. However, we have extended the contract, and it continues to be a profitable, very desirable opportunity for us., The third area was at AWS, but it was simply a reclassification of certain expenses that had previously been in SG&A and now we are classifying them as part of cost of sales. As we looked at it a little closer and mapped it in to the company and saw how we were treating similar cost at other business units, we concluded it made more sense to call it cost of sales. So that's simply a geography re-class on the income statement. So those are the three drivers, and they all had – that explains virtually the entire reduction in the margin, and they all had impacts that were meaningful., So Joe, I think our guidance in that – on that score is really not changing very much. I think what we would point out is if you looked historically back at the segment, this is a segment that traditionally generated gross margins of anywhere from 15.5 to roughly 16.5%. And we saw that go up dramatically in fiscal '10. First quarter of last year was actually lower than we're quoting this year, but it was already on the rise. And then if you looked at second quarter and third quarter last quarter, we had very strong margins., We were pretty transparent during that whole time that we knew those margins were not here to stay and that they would come back down, but our expectation is when margins ultimately settle in in the segment. They should settle in slightly higher than our historical norm because we've generated some of that margin improvement by – through factors that should stay with us, such as our low-cost manufacturing facility that we opened up, et cetera. So that's what we've been saying, and I think we'll continue to say – that continues to be our guidance with respect to margins in that segment., Yeah, Tyler, you've followed us long enough know, we have traditionally not provided a lot of guidance for a variety of reasons. We decided to deviate from that practice as we ended fiscal '10 and going into fiscal '11 in large part to try to set a common set of expectations with the investor base. We had a lot of wide range of expectations out there., I think we accomplished our mission with that, and our current thinking is we're not really going to get in the business of providing quarterly guidance again. So we're not saying anything with respect to that priority though. We do feel very good about the business though, and we feel good about our environment., Tyler, there's been a surge, if you will, in activity supporting the customer. The aircraft have been coming through maintenance, and we've been trying to speed up the maintenance process. So, together with our partners, we're gaining more experience around the aircraft., And the month of September is starting off better than the month of August, let's say. And historically and traditionally in this kind of market, early on in the program you experience slightly a more challenging environment than you do as the program matures and as we gain more experience around the program. So the KC-10 program is a large program, and the maintenance is being performed at a couple of different sites., We are in the process of repositioning inventory to the different sites so that we – as we move forward, we'll need less people in the process. Right now, we're throwing people and resources at the aircraft and less people and resources in October than we have in September, less in November than October. And hopefully by January, we'll be experiencing the kind of margins that we expect., Yeah, well we're looking at that bid. We're aware of the bid, obviously. The bid does have a certain weight requirement for the aircraft that many of our aircraft did not meet. But we do have other solutions for that – on that situation. So we are compete – we will be competing in that. As we see it today, we will be competing on that situation., No, I would just add, Tyler, to recall all of our 737-400s are on lease today; nothing's parked., We have operators for all of those aircraft today., My view is that the pricing is firmer today than it was, say, a year ago., So my anticipations of pricing, based on prior cycles, the pricing will continue to firm., Hi, Arnie., Well, let's just start with the math, so the – Arnie, your math of 58 times 4 – you're right, it's in the range, and that's all we were trying to do is to say that – point out to everybody that absent future growth that's what our expectation should be. And we wanted to make sure everybody understood that because we had put a $180 million target out there when we bought the company. We – with respect to that we appreciate your labeling that conservative, but that was our expectation. Most of the change does come from the new business we won. We are getting a little bit of increased volume under some of the contracts we inherited, but most of it is coming from new aircraft we won, since we've owned it., So we're not attempting to signal that there are no more growth prospects for AWS. In fact, we remain encouraged by the pipeline of activity we have out there., Yeah, it wouldn't be uncommon that you'd see low single digits, low double-digit growth. It's like – my sense is that it's hard to say whether that kicks in tomorrow or whether it takes a few more months, but if you look at, again from a historical perspective, and you look at how we've done say in past cycles, it would be my sense that you'll see – you'll first see low single digit, single – I'm sorry – low double-digit growth rates., And then the – on the Part side and the Service side, or the MRO side, it's somewhat predicated on deal flow that we might see, but my sense is that you're going to see some strengthening in that business as well. I wouldn't want to put a growth rate on that at this moment, but I do believe that you're going to see consistent, steady – steadier performance at higher levels coming out of that business starting in Q2., So, Arnie, let's just be clear. We said our performance in the first quarter was consistent with our expectations for the commercial markets that were implied and behind the guidance we had provided for the year. The one exception to that is the seasonal pattern in MRO. So you should certainly see MRO pickup, but everything else is consistent with our expectations., It's not going to take too long here where the Mesa comparison is going to be a non-item for the company., Hi, Ken., We would expect, at this moment at least, we're still operating under some pricing pressure. We've entered into agreements with our customers that restrict our – or limit our pricing flexibility. We would anticipate as we add incremental business that the pricing will be firmer, and we would anticipate that as we move on using our end time-frame of 18 months, let's say, that he asked in the prior question, we would expect the pricing would be improving in that period., Yes., That transition is in process right now, Ken, and there is an impact on margins as you've seen in the Structures and Systems results today. So we're not expecting any kind of further negative impact on margins of significance as we complete the transition over to Oshkosh., Hey, Tim, you want to take a shot at that?, Sure. Our engine shop customers are busy. So we're seeing, I think, what I would characterize as good demand for engine parts. On the supply side, we've been able to find, I think, good supply to go ahead and meet the requirements of our customers. So on the Engine Parts side, I think I would characterize the market as pretty favorable., On the Aircraft side, we're seeing our customers invest in inventory after a long period of taking inventory levels down. So I think it's the dynamics are similar and the behavior is similar between the Airframe side and the Engine Parts side., Thanks, Ken., Hi, J.B., Hi, J.B., On the investment of inventory?, Yeah, I mean, when we filed our Q you'll see the details obviously in there, but I mean we're happy to share that a little bit with you. I mean, our inventory across the company went up about $8 million relative to where we ended the last fiscal year. And when we look at where we were investing, we invested really, I think, in a couple of primary places. We had a little bit of inventory support to support some of the fleet growth at AWS. We're also investing in some inventory in support of the Engineering Services project that I mentioned in my comments that are – is part of our MRO group and will contribute to stronger results in the back half of the year., Both of those, I think. I mean, you could argue both of those are new contract wins., Correct., Sure., Hi, Eric., Hi, Eric., Yeah, Eric, it's Tim. I think the underlying trends are positive. We're seeing several of our customers are adding aircraft to their fleets, and we're – we've been supporting them as they do this. The Indianapolis facility, it has four customers in it today, not all know that they're lined, which is our goal, but nonetheless it's busy., And what we see is over time some of the bays that are being handled with a lower hour mod work and things like that will migrate to more noticeable detail, increasing the utilization of the facility. But all of our MROs, as Rick mentioned, are busy following the peak flying summer season. I think the underlying trends are favorable., I don't think the new environment is going to impact this particular business. I think if I'm hearing correctly, you're asking about the AWS?, Yeah, my feeling is that the entire Government Service, the entire Government market is going to be under some pressure here as they look to rein in the budget. I do believe that within the government and defense budget that the areas that we are heavily weighted towards are going to be less impacted by that budget pressure, but I do believe there will be budget pressure. I do believe that many of the things that we do are at a lower cost than the government, any alternatives that the government has, and I do believe that the things, the services that we are providing are critical to the ongoing performance of – in particular the DoD., One thing to think about as you think about the company's position is – and if I zero in on the AWS opportunity for a second – today 100% of that business other than the one contract that we have with the – on the service side with a Middle East customer, 100% of the business is with DoD. We are – we do believe there are opportunities with other branches of the U.S. government as well as other governments. So we are fairly optimistic and even as you look at some of the other Service offerings that we have, that we do see opportunities beyond just supporting DoD., The contracts that we have – the existing contracts that we have are – the pricing is already in place. So that pricing other than – Rick alluded to a 22-year contract that we have with a British MoD, which had certain breaks, pricing breaks inside the contract. Most of our other contracts are fixed price in structure., But what I'm more referring to is future business opportunities for the company as a result of the new environment that you've identified., Right, correct., So, Eric, the cash flow – as you know the cash flow from operations was about 60% of our net income for the quarter. It does reflect, I mean we got into this a little bit with J.B's question earlier, but, yes, we did invest in some of the kind of traditional working capital areas of the business. So we invested in some inventory; we invested in some rotable spares to support the growth at AWS. We also have made some investments in the A400M program as we bring that development process to closure. So all of that impacted us in the quarter and contributes to the impact you see. I don't think – as you know from studying our business in the past Eric, is if we're seeing growth on the commercial side, we typically invest to support some of that growth. And I'd say, we'll probably take the question about what our expectations are for rest of the quarter off line and think about that a little more, and we'll get back to you., We believe in creating free cash flow, and it's our objective to create free cash flow. You're not going to see it at the level you saw in late 2009, 2010, when we are generating free cash flow three to four times our net income. But I think you will – you should expect to see free cash flow generation from us on a recurring basis., Not directly that metric, Eric. We are certainly tied heavily to keeping a strong balance sheet though. So any efforts to lever up the balance sheet considerably and go on a spending spree of assets would certainly negatively impact us., Thank you., Yes, Jon, I think it's a really good question. We're kind of working with the leadership team, and we – as you'll note, we recently brought on retired two-star General from the Army who is the Head of – Director of Army Aviation. We're strategizing on this very question as we speak, and we do have a strategy session with the new President of the business coming up here early October to address this very issue. We are seeing a fair amount of demand today for additional investments, and we're kind of weighing the investment right now, considering these investments as we speak, basically., So my preference here would be to defer answering until we have a clearer picture. Suffice to say, though, that the environment is very favorable, and we are looking for ways to capture business in some cases without making investments. We added some aircraft in the last quarter where we're leasing the aircraft in. So I think this is an area that's important to us, and some that we are exploring at this time., The contracts are typically five years in duration. They're one-year firm with four year – four option years. And I believe that's the case. Tim, do you know specifically on these if that's the case?, That is the case., So what we have in the case of the five aircraft that we've bought in, we own four. One replacement aircraft that was actually that was damaged. And so we added – from an acquisition standpoint, we added three aircraft and then we're leasing-in couple of aircraft., And the aircraft that we own, we have a high level of confidence that if the contract that we – that we're performing against were to be – were to end that we would be able to redeploy these assets elsewhere., So we are obviously looking at what the back door is to each one of these investments. And we feel pretty confident based on dialogue we've had with the State Department, dialogue we've had with TRANSCOM, and dialogue we've had with some other foreign – potential foreign customers that we feel pretty good about the investments that we've made., F-61s., Were the acquisition – were the aircraft that we acquired, and, the aircraft that we're leasing in and to have on the SEs., It was approximately $2 million, Jon., Thanks., Well, I think, Stan, I mean we'll start by reiterating. We said we expected a net CapEx plan of $60 million. Certainly, we spent a good chunk of that in the first quarter, but there remains a bit to go there. So that would be – that's kind of earmark number one. Number two is, again, I think as we continue to monitor the tempo of growth around – growth and growth opportunities around the business, and particularly around some of the commercial areas of the business, we've made investment assets for that as well., We think we get sufficient returns on those, and we create pretty high hurdle rates as we contemplate those investments that it makes sense to use the cash in that manner. I think after that, I think you've seen some of what we've done. Buying direct stock this quarter was unique, but certainly remains in consideration for us and also taking in some of our bonds if they are at the right prices. We've done quite a bit of that. So all of that remains, I think, addressable from our perspective., I'm sorry, Stan, you cut out there for a second. Could you say that question again?, Yeah, we have basically the non-cash and the cash part of our interest costs, Stan, and so our interest expense real roughly is about, all in on a GAAP basis, will be about $30 million for the year. And you're doing that – that's off of face value of debt of approximately $450 million, roughly. It's a little bit higher than that, but just to keep the math simple. So at a gross basis, it's 6 – it's about 6.5 to 6.7%. But I would point out to you that quite a bit of that interest is actually non-cash interest expense. So if you're thinking about it on a cash perspective, it would be quite a bit lower; it would be about half of that., The best yield, the highest yield., Part of that's rate and part of that is duration., Where it's available, Stan. I mean clearly our – some of our bonds you don't have to pay a premium to take that in early. Some of the other financing we have would – maybe higher cost but would require premium to take it out. So we have to weigh all of that, when we think about taking it out., 6.8 is where we're at, and we would hope to cross 7 here in the near future and get up – get back to that 10 in this current planning cycle. We're in the first year of a three-year planning cycle., That's correct., Hey, Tim., Yes, Stan, we have been – we have been successful in hiring some people. We're looking for a broad range of people from engineers to technicians. But we did have a job fair in Kansas City, and we did see some good people there, and we've been able to bring some over to our businesses. And in terms of the overall look at the business, as I said earlier, I think we're encouraged by what we're seeing – we're talking to a lot of customers about their maintenance requirements. As we said, our shops are busy. So we are feeling okay about the – about our prospects here., It is., Well, Delta already outsources airframe maintenance. They have internal capability through Delta TechOps, but they also use the third-party repair centers as well., Thank you., Thanks, Stan., Hi, Tom., We feel – in a general sense we just feel better about the commercial market today than we felt 90 days ago., For this activity, Tom, we're one of very few qualified providers, particularly for the DoD. So DoD has a requirement called the CARB Certification, and there are very few – there are only two other operators who comply with CARB Certification. And we believe that AAR is better positioned than both the other two competitors to compete in this sector. And we feel good about our competitive position, and we feel very good about the opportunities in front of us. So yeah, I think it's a good market for the Company, Say it one more time, please?, No, no that standard is specifically a DoD standard. Now it's part of our marketing ploy. And the reason that standard is – exists – is because the DoD takes more caution around safety of flight than other agencies might. And we're trying to bring that requirement over to the other agencies. And we're at least meeting with interest – people are interested in what we have to say. So I think if we can, yeah, obviously if we can figure out a smart way to expand our capability, then we should be able to differentiate ourselves. And these are the markets today. It's not uncommon for other users to utilize eastern equipment, for instance. We're trying to convince folks to use Western equipment as a more safer and reliable source of equipment., All right. Thanks, Tom., Jon., Yes. We prefer not to disclose the breakout at this point in time. Suffice to say, that the maintenance business has been actually operating as a byproduct, if you will, of the core airlift operation. And we believe by integrating that business into the AAR service and to the universe, that we'll be able to make that a more meaningful piece of the business going forward., We will not be acquiring the facility. We'll be, for a period of time, leasing the facility, and it would be our intentions to relocate from that current facility., No, not at all. The type of activity that they are in today are transporting personnel and transporting supplies around the different theatres. They are also involved – they have a contract with the Navy to resupply U.S. naval ships in the Western Pacific with cargo and mail as well as transportation of personnel. They have an airlift contract in Africa that provides transportation logistics and casualty evacuation services., So there's no weaponry involved, there's no transport of weaponry, there's no weaponry connected with the aircraft in any way, shape or form. So this is really about repositioning personnel and cargo around the different theatres of operation, and they're not all in war zones, let's say., Let me just add also that we see, as Randy said in his comments, we see tremendous growth in ancillary markets. So a fair amount of homeland security demand is out there for this kind of activity. And then of course, you get, from time to time you get disaster recovery activity. These folks did provide support back in the post-Katrina time period., And yes, so as we look at how the U.S. asset base is being somewhat stretched, I should say, that we see numerous opportunities for this kind of contract, lift demand emerging around the world. And not just in support of the United States, also in support of NATO and in support of Canada and in support of other countries as well., I'm not sure if they were or not. I don't believe so, but that would be an example of something they could do, yes., Most of them are actually firm fixed price., And the contracts, as you can see from the numbers that Rick indicated, the business is run very, very efficiently, and as a result profitably., That was for AAR, Jon. So yes, I wanted to --., I was saying, this is going to build on what we believe is a very positive momentum wave that we've created of free cash flow generation., Thanks., Hey, J.B., No, they're not BLACK HAWKs, they're small. There's a couple of different varieties of them, J.B. They're Bell 412 helicopters --., And then MD 530s as well. So it's a little mix of fleet, but they're not BLACK HAWKs., I'm sorry, say that again., J.B., this is David., The aircraft currently in service are Puma, Sikorsky and Bell. The Puma 330Js, the Sikorsky S-61s and the Bell 214s., And you had talked about BLACK HAWKs. The BLACK HAWK work they're doing is the mod work. So they have a contract with the UAE to perform mod work on brand new Sikorskys that come down from Connecticut. Each aircraft gets 38 mods installed by AWS, or the subsidiary STI, and that is work on BLACK HAWKs. But they do not operate or fly BLACK HAWKs., And the aircrafts that came back from Iraq are what Rick alluded to, the 16 Bell 412s and the four MD 530s. The 530, a relatively small aircraft, and the 412s are smallish as well for that matter., Yes, we'll pick up a little stub period, J.B., in our fiscal '10. But yes, it will essentially line up with fiscal '11 and fiscal '12 for us when we talk in terms of year one and year two., Thanks., Yes. Let me first say that the current contracts are in different theaters, one of which – and the way to think about this business is, on the front end, you have the – let's say the military activity, then you have the nation building activity, and then you have the humanitarian possibilities. So the action today is – and the VERTREP, which is the vertical – the replenishment on the DoD – on the U.S. Navy contract, is not for aircraft – ships that are in a theater of – in a war zone in any way, shape or form. And Africa, for instance, the Africa operations are about nation building., So as you look forward out into the future, what I see you having is these specialized needs that come up, counter-narcotics situations, border patrol situations like we talked about in terms of requirements. As the U.S. airlift organic assets get stretched, there are going to be different pockets of opportunities that emerge, whether it be in the nation building, conflict zones or other things that the country is trying to achieve., Yes, Larry, I mean, we'll have to do a formal purchase accounting exercise post closing. We have done a preliminary review of that, and as you point out, there will be a number of intangible assets likely created on the books that will require amortization. Those will include things like the licenses that the company owns, some of the customer relationships it has, but also contract values. So contracts in place tend to get valued and created as an asset that are quickly amortized. And it's because of that last piece is why we expect a greater degree of amortization to hit us in year one than in subsequent years., Thanks, Larry., Hey, Eric., Eric., Yes. First, yes, we feel very confident telling you that it'll be accretive in year one. I would expect a little – some right out of the box, Eric, as well, but a lot of that depends on when we actually get it closed and how quickly we invest in some of the operational upgrades that I talked about. So I think, again, let's think of it in terms of the full first year as accretive., I'm not expecting it. I just am saying, I'm not going to be as robust in telling you it's going to be accretive right out of the box., No. The way we partitioned the fleet for you, Eric, is again we said that there's 38 that are actively under contract and generating revenue and part of the core operation. And there are these other 20 that we talked to that are, again, either available for sale or potentially could be redeployed, but we see them as a separate pool., Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think the way to look at it is if you see Global Solutions as the front-end and the contract holder, and you see AWS as the fulfillment arm on the airlift situations, I think that's the way to look at it. So the opportunity pool that the folks at Global are looking at today include many of these air operation opportunities., So far it feels that way, and I think that's one of the things that gets us kind of excited. Randy, in the due diligence process, went around to talk about the transaction with numerous of the customers. He got very positive feedback on the fact that AAR was stepping in to the picture, and of course, he was looking for other ways to expand the AAR helicopter story, if you will, in particular., So if you look around the Army, the Army obviously operates a lot of helicopters. And actually if you look back on some of our recent wins with Sikorsky and some of the stuff we've been doing in the helicopter universe, you'll see that this is becoming a more meaningful part of the AAR picture. And as you look forward on the – looking at that modification side, you think about the reset opportunities within the helicopter universe, we see this positioning us in a more positive fashion., We will be attending the Quad-A conference, which is Army conference, all about helicopters later – actually mid-April. I'll actually be attending the conference; it will be my first time there. And AAR will be showing and participating much more assertively than we have in the past., Let me also make a comment, if I may, on the accretion comment. And that is that we have – Rick has not indicated and we have not indicated any benefits of any synergies that we see in terms of putting into an earnings per share calculation. And we do see today there is a meaningful maintenance spend and there is also a supply chain opportunity. So Randy – the supply chain, the defense supply chain business reports to Randy, and Randy will be utilizing their services into this operation very quickly., And we see that as an opportunity on two fronts. One is to obviously improve the profitability on the supply chain. But secondly, to improve the performance on the supply chain, which will add incremental revenues on the contracting side because we'll be able to – the aircraft will be more utilizable, which will allow us to keep the aircraft flying more which will allow us to bill more., Yes., Eric., Hi, Peter., Rick, will you take that?, Yes. I mean, Peter, just rough numbers. We've done roughly $600 million of government-related work over the last year. And we've historically seen the split on products, about 70% services, about 30% of that. So if you take 600 up to 800, and all of this would be considered a service, I think you're getting pretty close to a 50/50 at that point., We just said it was going to be accretive to both margins and earnings, Peter. And I think, after we sort out how we map their P&L into ours and what goes into SG&A versus what goes into cost of sales, I think we can talk more about some of the margin with a little more specificity. But I think you can certainly take the earnings accretion guidance we've given and some of the other data we've given, and you can back into that pretty easily if you want to., Correct., Thanks, Peter., Thanks., There is some distribution on it, Jon. I mean, as I mentioned, we just – or the company just won a award really two weeks ago, that's a $40 million chunk of business that is brand new. So that obviously doesn't renew for some time. We'd have some other contracts that are renewable in about a year's time, year to year-and-a-half's time. So there is a little bit of a distribution. But I mean, nothing is falling off a cliff right away., What I'm referring to is more a standpoint of the aircraft can't take off. So it doesn't – it'll lose the revenue opportunity in theater because it doesn't have the right spare part at the right place., This is similar to what we've seen as we've taken on the program, the AWACS program and the JSTARS program, similar characteristic in that the dispatch reliability is suspect as a result of poor or a lacking focus around supply chain., By putting Randy's supply chain experts into this process, we'll improve dispatch reliability, which will allow the aircraft that are currently under where we can – where we charge based on the flights that we actually make, we'll be able to make more flights. And the opportunity – we view the opportunity as somewhere between three and five million a year., Let me also say, Jon, you've said 100% utilization. I think what Rick has said is 100% of the revenue for the next 12 months is already booked., We do have 20 parked aircrafts., Right, I don't think so. And we've not had any dialogue with them about any other entities. They've put this business up for sale, and we were very attracted to it right from the outset. You might recall, Tim has been talking about building our helicopter business for quite sometime. And a year or so ago, he hired a marketing chap out of Sikorsky who heads up our helicopter, gets us a lot of visibility in the helicopter world. So this business, amongst their businesses, is probably the only one that would appeal to us., All right, thank you., Yeah. First of all, Larry we are seeing an uptick in our commercial aviation activity. We saw that beginning in the month of February. We've seen it continue through the month of March and we expect that trend to continue., In terms of capacity being added to the system, I think as load factors continue to rise, and there's all indications that's taking place, you'll start seeing aircraft come back into the system, and not just here in the United States but elsewhere around the globe as well. So we think that there's a better feel – a stronger feeling today than there may have been, say, three months ago., So Larry, so let's start by just – I'll reiterate my – what I said earlier. Excluding the Mesa effect in the quarter..., ...we're right around 21.5-ish, same place as we were in Q2. So you're in the zip code of what I think you're asking about in terms of 22 and higher. Certainly, if you look back over the last couple of years, I think, we've demonstrated pretty consistent pattern in that range that you're talking about., KC-10 will be, I think, a little bit margin dilutive at the gross margin level, margin neutral as we look at it from an operating margin perspective. So as that ramps a little bit that will put a little pressure on the segment margin, but I think structurally – we obviously had a big fall-off in our first quarter, if you just look at this historically, and then we came back quite a ways in the second quarter. You saw a kind of a repeat performance in Q3, and what you're hearing from us is we still don't feel the markets have recovered back to where we think they will recover to. So with stronger markets that should help margins a little bit and then pressuring that will be a little bit on the ramp on KC-10., Well, clearly the backlog at our mobility systems business has peaked, but as the KC-10 ramps up there's – that throws off, excuse me, throws off a significant amount of repairs across the company. So that will offset some of the forecasted decline at mobility., Larry, I would add, though, recognize – we've made some comments about AAR Global Solutions; that is all really designed to serve Government and Defense customers. It's an area we continue to invest in and remain optimistic that there's opportunities there. So I think we still remain bullish about the Government and Defense space., Hi., Yes, Tyler, we did have another success but we're – it's a little premature in terms of further discussion on it, but we're not quite certain yet what the size is of this – of a win that we've been verbally advised of. But yeah, we continue to see opportunities. We continue to refine the business model. And we remain pretty – still feel pretty good about the market segment and we think we'll get some traction sometime between now and the end of the calendar year., I would say there's more outstanding today than there were three months ago., Yeah, I think as it relates to margins, let's hold off for now in terms of communicating a margin target for that specific business. We are competing for other opportunities in that market and it is, kind of, in a ramp-up mode, so it will be a little bit premature for us to speculate on margins. The margins in the existing composite business that we have are fairly consistent with what we see in our Structures group but as we see that – the volumes increase, we would hope we get more efficient and we get margin throughput. But my preference at this stage, Tyler, this is early on in some of the wins that we have recently announced. Let's talk about that in, say, another couple of quarters out as we get a little bit more practical experience., Yeah, Tyler, I would just pile on to that, just for context, when we talked about a $100 million annual goal for the composite business, which we continue to strive for, that's sort of tripling the size of the business from where we started it. And you can imagine the scale benefits that could occur with that type of growth. So I think that's why we need to settle in at those higher levels before we can really talk to you about sustainable margins., Right., I mean, historically, as you start bringing business in – new business in, particularly in the MRO area, there's an adjustment period, a phase-in period, to get used to the customer's specific requirements and for us to adjust to their nuances. And we have obviously – we have done this enough times to know and have enough visibility in terms of – we can't quite predict exactly where the challenges will be. We just know that there will be challenges. And we have recently had some significant success in attracting new business, so I think we'll continue to see certain challenges in that regard., But we do anticipate, for instance, as we get into the fourth quarter versus the third quarter that some of the challenges we saw in the third quarter will be – we'll have more of a handle on and we'll have better operating results as a result of that experience., Same thing on the KC-10, I mean, this is a very large program. There was an incumbent supplier to that program who is – wasn't too pleased that they lost the program and they've made the handoff a little bit more challenging than you'd like to see. But that being said, we started the program in February. We understand today where many of the challenges are. And it might be a little tough here in March and April, but I think as we get to May and as we get out into the next fiscal year, you'll – we'll get past the transition phase then we'll get into the normal operating environment where the company excels., So you're correct in identifying the fact that we've had some meaningful wins here, and you are correct that many of these programs do have startup challenges. Some of those startup challenges are behind us, and some of those startup challenges still remain in front of us., In the case of Alaska, for instance, it's the same aircraft so there's no surprises. Just getting additional throughput, so that should be very easy for us, if you will., In the case of Hawaiian, we'll be working on their 717s. We have 717 proficiency for the work we've been doing with AirTran. However, they'll have their special requirements, which will be different than AirTran's special requirements and so there will be an adjustment period that goes along with that., In the case of Allegiant, we have work on two different types of work with Allegiant. One is there normal annualized heavy check maintenance where we have some experience. But we're also inject – bringing their aircraft that they've recently acquired from SAS; we're putting those aircraft onto their operating certificate. And that has – that type of work has surprises because you're not sure exactly what you're getting – or in this case what they're getting. And that takes a lot of handholding and a lot of hard work to make that work, that transition work, if you will., So yeah, I think that you're – again, we have enough experience in this to know that there are surprises and yet we don't know exactly where the surprises are, but we're – we've got our arms – we do have our arms around it. We're not expecting any major surprises., First, on the mobility, it's just – we've been wrapping up some of our contracts for containers and shelters. So now that gets reloaded but right now the – and there's some contracts opportunities that are in front of us. But right now we're working down the backlog, at least for the time being., And then in terms of Composites, we're getting ready for some of the new work. But we're still in the engineering and design phase there. And again, we're working off of deliveries from previously issued awards., In fact, the door is not closed. So I guess it still is an option, yes., Good morning., We would be ahead of both Q1 and Q2 at this point in time in the quarter. But keep in mind now, we're at March 17, so it's pretty early in the quarter. But we would be ahead of where we were, say, in December and September., Or higher, probably higher than that, Eric. I mean, as we talked about, just for everybody's benefit, we think it's a 60 to $70 million a year opportunity for us. There is a ramp-up, so eventually we'll get to a normal quarterly run rate of somewhere between 15 and $18 million. And so I think – I don't think we'll be quite there for Q4 but it will be above the range you asked., I mean, yeah – I mean, let's just talk about – we did 122 this quarter, we're talking about a delta on KC-10 of, let's just say, 10 million in round numbers. So you can do the math from there., We're looking to be busier in the fourth quarter. We are seeing a lot of work coming in. I will say though, Eric, that the hours that we're putting on the aircraft are a little less than you might have seen historically. But the short answer is we look to have a modest sequential revenue increase in MRO., I think what you're hearing from us, Eric, is we're burning down some backlog. I'll repeat what Tim said is there is other – there are opportunities to reload some of that that we're working on right now. We do expect still a strong performance out of our mobility business and the segment in the fourth quarter. But we don't typically do predictions of revenue on a segment basis. So I don't want to give you , Well, you know, you've followed us for a while, Eric, so I don't have to tell you if you look back historically what sort of normal might be from – if you look at the historical numbers. Now I think we've had a couple of very good quarters in a row. I think we've been up front by saying we don't think that is a sustainable level for the long term. But I also don't expect it to fall off a cliff from where it is. So I think when you say high teens that's probably the right place to think about it., We're in pretty good shape. We have – the fleet is very similar to where it was at the last discussion. So we are in negotiations on some lease extensions that we expect to be successful with, so really no real change to that market at this stage., I mean just to be clear, no additions or subtractions during the quarter., Yeah, I think that's a good summation and I think we – the phrase we used last quarter, modest sequential improvement, is kind of what we would say again this time., Sure., Yeah, we're seeing some of that kind of activity. We're seeing new aircraft coming into customers' fleets. We're working with a customer right now actually, on some additions of aircraft into their fleet. So yeah, we are seeing some of that right now., Thanks, J.B., Predominantly Mesa, Jon. There was one other much smaller carrier that also added to that number., Yeah, I mean, it all – it showed up as well on – really in the margin performance in Structures and – excuse me, in Supply Chain as well, Jon. And I – I'm sorry, I tried to provide some of those details, but I mean, we -, Yeah, on the margin side, right., And we also had a revenue reduction., So what in effect happened is we had some work in process related to our supply chain support of Mesa where we had incurred the costs of making some repairs and some other services but were not able to bill those. So the costs were in our cost of sales, but we didn't bill it on the revenue line and so you have – you sort of had the impact hitting you in many different places on our P&L., Yeah, subject to their restructuring plan., Obviously, Jon. We continue to obviously support them, and we continue to have an inventory position to support that as well, but subject to their restructuring plan we do think all the kind of one-time type of charges are behind us. We've signaled to you what we think the new volumes from Mesa will be. And that's all we know at this point in time., Okay. Well -, Well, we obviously have a very strong liquidity position right now, Jon, so we have the means but I would say when we were very active buying back debt a year ago, it was because of very advantageous., ...market conditions., Those same market conditions don't exist, so it's certainly not the same business case it would have been a year ago, but we definitely – for the right opportunity, we would certainly be ready to strike if that was – if that made sense., So Stan, we – there is a fair amount of deal flow and stuff that we're looking at today, and obviously we're staying very disciplined. We've worked hard to go ahead and generate the cash that we have and to earn the cash position that we currently have. So we are looking at certain – at some opportunities and some stuff is pretty far down the pipeline, if you will, or process, I should say, and yeah, we'll see what happens., Okay. Thank you., Yes, we've not really seen much of an uptick in January. We've seen the business – we have a couple of very large programs, we support Delta, we support MTU, and MTU, of course, supports multiple air carriers. And what we've seen is we've seen very modest uptick. We were all expecting because we were led to believe by the customers that we'd be expecting more meaningful uptick in January. We had communicated that as late in December, and yet the actuality has been we haven't seen what we were hoping to see, and the same thing in February. Although we – last week, I mean it so happens that we've seen a little bit of an uptick, but I wouldn't want to say that's a trend at this stage. I think that market is still pretty tight; that'd be our experience. We get it from the new side, the used side, the repair side and so we see it – we see it in North America, Europe, Asia. So we have a pretty good cross-section, and so far it's been relatively flat. Haven't seen the bounce that we expected., Right, right. So the feedback is get ready. But, I don't want to – that's why I'm pushing this off till the middle of the year because we were ready in November and December for January, and we just haven't seen what we have been led to believe we might be seeing. So I think people are still very cautious in terms of their spending. Yes, sir., Yes, if you look at the past, if you look at the trends in say '93, one of my advantages and one of my disadvantages is that I've been doing what I'm doing for a long time. So I've been in this business for 31 years at AAR, and I've been president of the company since '89, so that's a positive and negative. And the positive side is, I've seen these kind of cycles, I saw the cycle in the early 90's, and the cycle in the early 2000s, and in both cases, when it comes back, it comes back in a real wave, in a vengeance. So we had in the years '91, '90, second half of '90, '91 and the early half of '90, actually through '92, we saw a real softness in commercial demand. And then by January '93, in January '93 we just had a tremendous uptick in activity and that just continued on still through the decade actually, and the same thing in post 9/11., You had softness in '02, you had softness in '03, but from '04, I can't remember the exact date in that cycle actually, but I do remember January '93. I don't remember exactly when it ticked up in the '04 period, but once it ticked up we had a real good run since then. So when it comes, it will come. I mean the key is the aircraft need more utilization, and we need more aircraft back in the systems. And doesn't matter the age of the aircraft because all aircraft require spare parts, it requires spare parts in forward locations and it requires spare parts through the maintenance cycle. Actually you can argue newer aircraft require more concentration because some of the parts are just in the infancy if you will of their development and need to be replaced on a fairly regular basis., We really haven't seen much of that. We do know that some of our equipment has gone into Haiti but not in a meaningful fashion., Yes, no real surprises. My sense is that the military planning has been anticipating that there will be more actions in Afghanistan. So, I think the supply chain had been steadily increased in anticipation that there'd be some activity there., Yes., Yes, yes, I mean I think the characterization of heavy maintenance would be a labor – it's a heavy labor component. So the work chases the lower labor costs as a general rule. So if you see wide bodies are done in places where you fly your wide bodies and you have the maintenance done there, it's less expensive on the labor side. On the narrow body maintenance, which is where most of our maintenance is, there's a point where it doesn't make a lot of sense to fly the aircraft for the reduced labor rate because of the cost of flying the aircraft and positioning your pilots and get support staff et cetera. Some airlines have brought their aircraft into Central America to chase a lower rate. We haven't really seen that impact our business in any way., Southwest, which is the large – we're the largest maintenance provider for Southwest send a couple lines down to Central America and whether they send it to Central America or  somewhere else in North America is not going to influence our business, because they're not going to give us much more in the way of lines. We're already getting between eight and 10 lines at any point in time and they want to spread the business just in case there is problem that emerges that either weather problem or some other problem emerges at a facility., So I don't view the Central America – and from a growth rate also any time you put a line into a facility, a line requires about 100 mechanics. And those mechanics have to be trained and they have to be versed in the equipment, they have to be versed in that particular carrier's maintenance technique., So there is a build-up process involved in hiring. Like we looked in Costa Rica at one point in time for instance, which is a beautiful spot. But they can hire 50 mechanics a year. So to get a full line would take two years to hire enough mechanics to handle eight lines. So it's got to be – before a carrier is going to send an aircraft in the mechanics have to be there and before they hire the mechanic they have to know they're going to get the line. So it's kind of dicey proposition., So the greater threat for us is around the capacity in North America and there is over-capacity today in North America. So the air carrier is aware of that, the air carriers are obviously under pressure, as they always have been and they're looking for lower rate, but they're also looking for – the carriers that we're attracting, if you look at our customer base today these are guys who were chasing not just competitive rate, but they're also chasing higher value., So Southwest, we agree that we'd spend $2 million in Indianapolis to build paint capacity for Southwest. So we take two or three days out of Southwest's cycle by having paint right there and those two to three days are meaningful for Southwest. And they value that and they're willing to pay a little bit for that as long as they get the aircraft out in time and the aircraft don't have any problems operating. We have really good track record in supporting Southwest., And I think Alaska looks at us the same way, Alaska looks at us as having a broader capability than they might find elsewhere. So they're willing to actually fly the aircraft to Oklahoma City, which is not on their route network, which is also an anomaly, or they're willing to fly the aircraft to Oklahoma City to go ahead and have AAR perform the maintenance., We have those – at this moment I don't have those at my fingertips, but we can get back to you with that information. We do track it; we do track value orders, value per order. I just don't recall right now what that is., The pricing has not been as much – on spare parts the pricing is not been – we've had some pressure on pricing, but not huge pressure on pricing. And most of the spare parts today we're providing are kind of on a just need – you need them now. So if you have the part, and it's in the right position at the right place, right time you're going to more than likely sell it. So you're seeing less volumes, but you're seeing pricing hold on. There is a little pricing pressure, but it's not what we would see let's say on the MRO side, which has more pricing pressure. And I think that's why we're looking at kind of the mix to our business. I mean if this was – if AAR looked the same in '09/'10 as we looked in '01, '02 we wouldn't be having very different results than what we're reporting today., Part of that is we have a much better mix and we're much deeper in the relationships we do have. Our volumes with Southwest have not really declined. They've come off just a little bit only because they've had a few less maintenance events, but in general the capture rate has increased not decreased and they recognize the importance of AAR to their entire maintenance chain and that business has been able to hold relatively steady. And then of course we have more international business and fortunate for us we diversified to the central government arena, which has been beneficial for us as well., Yes, sure., I would say that in Sikorsky's case we're having broad discussions with them because we're also doing service work for them as well. And we're doing some mod work on their tail booms on the S-92 in our Oklahoma City facility, and we're looking at different ways we can team with them on the service side. So where they are the front-end they may capture the service contract, AAR may do some of the component work and support them, and we're doing some of that today. So the relationship is becoming more institutionalized if you will as opposed to transaction based. The chap who runs my structures group used to be the CEO of Bell Helicopter, and he is – so he's got wonderful relationships there. So we understand what the Bell Helicopter opportunities are as well as Cessna and we have good relationships in both places. They're not as advanced as we've been able to enjoy with Sikorsky and we've been kind of all over the Sikorsky relationship if you will, and as the opportunities present themselves, at Bell and Cessna we'll be there to, we are – we are spending a fair amount of time with Gulfstream – we're on the G450, and G550. We are talking with Spirit about supporting them on the G5 – G650.  I think – and those talks proceed. And we are having one of good discussions and good dialogue with Board. they don't look into subcontract acquire for Board so I mean we have a good mix, we have a wonderful team in place, and I would expect to that segments of our business will continue to work., Absolutely, absolutely. Lockheed we see that in discussions with Lockheed we actually what we've done is we have taken our precision structure, our precision machining business and our composite business and it's under one leadership team. So we market jointly, we lead it jointly. We've had good dialog with Sikorsky on machine parts as well as composite parts. We have had good dialog with Lockheed Martin on both as well; as a matter of fact we are in major discussions with Lockheed on composite work, which if we do it will require a significant investment on our parts, so we are kind of playing with that right now. But nevertheless you are correct by having more capability clearly we have a bigger audience, and we are looking to grow both of those as well so we can become even more important to those guys. And in terms of word partnership, the word partnership it depends on who you are and how you define the word partnership I mean I may have a view of partnership, you may have a different view of partnership. And at the end of the day many of these relationships even though they may call them partnerships, they still are vendor/supplier relationships; but at least there is a theme of partnering when they sense you can do more work for us, yes., Any other questions? Okay well thank you, I appreciate it., We are seeing signs of our business picking up in the commercial markets. So we are seeing increased inquiry level and we are seeing more input level. So we are – it's too early to say that a turnaround or a trend necessarily has taken place. However, we have seen an improving level of inquiries coming into the company. And as a result, we have seen our sales pick up a bit as well., In terms of the competitive market – competitive environment, the customers are looking for extremely good pricing, and we're taken the position as we have here now really since January '09 of really looking at the -- capturing market share, growing market share and not just maintaining our customers, but seeking new customers. And so therefore, we are seeing a little bit of pricing pressure. I would expect it as this recovery – if we are in the early stages of the recovery, I would expect the pricing to firm up here as we move along., We've moved that number down slightly. We have moved that number down into our numbers in the 30, $35 million range., I think this quarter we looked at 30 million of revenue contribution., And also, that was for as you said we closed on April 7, so that's revenues from April 8 , There are approximately 20 aircraft as you suggested and – helicopters and we are engaged in discussions with folks who are interested in acquiring those aircraft from us. So we will continue to advance those discussions. We don't see those aircraft long-range in our plans, one of the goals of this business is to simplify the operating structure, one of the challenges is the number of fleets that they currently -- different fleet types that they operate, we are trying to simplify that a little bit. So the two model helicopters which are grounded and if we are successful in selling those, then that'll reduce our complexity fairly significantly., Our plan is to be positive, I agree with you, we are seeing and we try to signal that we are seeing opportunities to invest more in the commercial market, and as we get a little bit more bullish on the prospects, we'd probably be inclined to do so. But we are planning on generating free cash flow for the year., We also, Larry, just to add, we will be making some investments; we have won some new contracts at AWS. So we will be investing in helicopters to support some of those – the contracts that we have won., Thank you very much., Hi, Ken., Yeah. I don't know that we have a whole lot more color to add to that, Andrew, other than when we say airframe that's also inclusive of some of our program related businesses as well. And I think we saw some – the nice part about the program business is it's less volatile and we have seen some nice pickup on that side. But I don't think we have a lot more color to add than that's just, that was the way the numbers came in for us., Ken, we're seeing some of that, we're seeing some aircraft coming out of the desert, which I think is part of the reason for David's comments on early signs of a recovery, and that is impacting some of our results. We are seeing some – the engine shops become a little bit busier. So I think there is still some volatility in the demand. But it feels like directionally that demand is returning for both engine and , Andrew, just so you're clear about, I know when you say plane coming out of desert that needs some overhaul work, I mean, that type of exercise would either be an MRO activity if the airplane needs to be worked on. I think capacity being reintroduced such as that after that, though, that certainly could trigger some of the airframe demand requirements we are seeing now., Absolutely. We still have capacity available within..., ...our facility, so we don't see a need to go ahead and extend that business. it's our lowest margin contributor around the company. It's been a wonderful portal for bringing business into the company, and I think we have sufficient portal space right now in our portfolio., Okay, Andrew., Yeah, Joe, still recognized in the quarter, we only had two months really of AWS, not three, so you should adjust for that. And I think again we did $30 million roughly in two months, so you can think of it as about $15 million a month roughly., So you can adjust for that. The KC-10 program was just about fully up to speed in Q4, but there is a little more headroom there, we think, as well., So I think you – I think you're looking more at a number closer to probably 100 million a quarter, The Hawaiian aircraft are – it is not a steady line. So we've done some aircraft. We're on hiatus now and we'll pick up again in the fall. And one of the things that we've seen in MRO as Rick mentioned in his comments is the summer flying season in particularly tough on – in the MRO, particularly in Miami, where many of their customers are – have all of their aircraft operating during the summer. In terms of Allegiant, we're still ramping those lines; we have done some work for Allegiant, but it hasn't kicked in completely yet., You know, we do – we're looking carefully at opportunities now to take inventory positions to support increases in demand both on the engine part side driven by demand at the engine shops, but also on the airframe side. So we are hopeful here that we will continue to see this uptick in demand., No, I did – I used both of those numbers, Tyler; 1.1 was related to acquisition cost related to AWS. 1.4 was what we incurred during the quarter related to Global Solutions. That wasn't a charge per se to shutting it down; it was just a normal burn rate that we had for the – for that activity for the quarter. It was subsequent to the end of the year that we had the decision to just shut it down. Having said that, I don't expect a significant charge with that decision., A little color around the closedown. We have retained some of the key contracts people that we were interested in retaining. We put them into some of our business units and we also picked up some of this capability in the AWS acquisition., Right., So Tyler, as you know, historically our goal has been to have SG&A as a percent of sales at or below 10%. We had a little bit a pickup here and our goal continues to be to work that down to the 10%. So I think in about the timeframe you've laid out, our goal would be to get it back down to the 10% of sales., Tyler, just to add to that. Once again, one of the things we faced this first year with AWS is purchase accounting, amortization, that's much greater in the first year than it will be subsequent. I mean that's a reality we talked about since we announced the deal. That's driving up the rate and as that burns off that will certainly help us get that rate back down., I think the program is performing about what – about how we expected it to perform. We are working through what I'd consider to be normal front-end implementation issue. It's a new program; it's a last program; it's a complicated program. But on balance, I think it's on track and we're looking to continue to improve our overall performance., Yeah. So the portfolio as it sits today, Tyler, really hasn't changed. We have five wholly-owned aircraft and 27 that are owned with joint venture partners. All the – lots of detail on each of those aircraft types, who they're leased to and what our expected disposition is will all be outlined in our 10-K, which we'll file at the end of this week, just the same way we disclosed it in the past. In terms of the P&L impact, I think the guidance I'll give you would be similar to what we saw in 2010. I would expect basically a breakeven outcome from the JV portfolio as we go through the year., We have 7 aircraft that are scheduled to come up for lease – 7 or 8, I'll have to double-check that for you. But all of them are being in discussion with the current operators about either extensions or in one case taking it back for disassembly., Current market conditions?, Relatively flat. I mean, we don't expect major changes., Hi, Eric., Hi, Eric., Well, they get pretty interrelated, right, Eric, as we've talked about in the past in the – what is a relatively soft demand environment, we can choose to either stay on the sidelines and hold out just for a price or we can participate in that soft demand which usually means you get some weaker margin performance. So it's hard to bifurcate it as much as you'd say. I mean, I think fundamentally demand has been softer than – certainly than we like it to be and certainly than we'd seen a year ago, and that's resulted in both a shortness at the top line as well as some of the margin degradation we've seen., I think I mentioned, Eric, that as we look at -- to answer the question around cash, free cash flow for the year, that we would be investing in some helicopters to support some of these contract wins -- and actually we also won a fixed line contract as well. In the case of fixed line contract, we are going to lease in the aircraft, so it'll be a lease-in, lease-out at pretty acceptable margins. And then on the rotary wing contract, we acquired, this fiscal year to date, we've acquired four helicopters to deploy into – against these contracts. So that's where we're getting the assets from. The fleet is fully utilized except for the aircraft as we communicated that came out of the Iraq theater that were put up for sale., Not – we spent – on four helicopters we've spent $30 million give or take., First of all, it's tremendous benefit moving into that arena. We learned about a whole market niche, if you will, within the government services arena. Obviously, the direct impact was finding the AWS acquisition, but I think at the same time, it opened up our eyes to a series of government support contracts that are out there that are -- kind of fit our model. So the contracting piece was – and the reason behind Global Solutions was to be the front end, if you would, to helping us drive more of our fulfillment capability into the end-user customer., We've always had the fulfillment capability. Of course we've added a bunch of it now with this AWS acquisition, but we didn't have the front-end piece and now we have been able to take out, cull from that business, some of the front end piece assets, put in into our businesses, and give us a little bit more ability around bidding and hopefully winning some contracts., At the same token, there may be other opportunities they merge further downstream that cause us to get a little bit more aggressive in terms of a front-end business of this nature showing up again. It might – it will probably a different form of what we previously did, but there could very well be additional impetus on our side to get more aggressive in that regard. It is a marketplace that is fit -- the end user market for the type of service for Global was designed to produce is a real fit for the skill sets that we have within AAR., Yes. Eric, so let me start with the CapEx. In part, it's going to be variable, quite variable based on potentially new bid wins at AWS. As David indicated, we've had some nice momentum already since we bought the company. We have some current bids that are outstanding as well, and if in fact we are successful with those, we'll acquire assets to fulfill them. And while we may be able to lease them in, I think we'd have to plan to potentially buy them. So I'd say all that, just to let you know, I mean, I think somebody earlier in the call called that a high-class problem, we look at it that way as well. So we're quite excited about those bid opportunities., Putting those aside, Eric, I think our CapEx, and when I say this inclusive of the money that David indicated that we've spent already on this business, our CapEx for the year should be between 55 and $60 million. With new bid wins, we may increase that number. Again, the nice thing is it's not -- you don't have to – buy the asset and hope you win the business. We can be assured of the business before we make that final commitment on the asset., Depreciation for the year, Eric. I'll have to get back to you with that. I think that number is going to be – for this year, we finished just under $40 million; we finished about 39. My expectation for this coming year is somewhere around 50 to 55, but we'll have to – I'll have to clarify that with you., Yeah, we're going into the year, Greg, with a $600 million backlog. As you know, much of our supply chain business isn't really backlog business. The AWS backlog went into the year as 125 million and the bulk of the remaining backlog is in our Structures and Systems segment., We'll go through the majority of the backlog, probably 70% of it, this fiscal year, Greg., As I said, the – it's a new program; we've only been on the program for a few months here, it's large, it's complex. I think it's going to take a little while here to kind of be running kind of as smooth as we are in some of our other programs. And as I said, I mean, I think as the – as our performance improve, I think there will be more efficiency., There is a fair amount of activity in AWS. We talked about the demand for this type of support, and we're seeing it in many different areas., Good morning., Good morning, J.B., On global, we won't be talking about that, we will have de minimis amount of tail to that, but that won't be something you'll hear us talking about prospectively., With regard to acquisition related cost, everything acquisition related on AWS in terms of deal related costs had been recognized, okay? So now future impact that SG&A from AWS will just be really a function of purchase accounting impact as well as again the nature of their business, which as we've talked about is a little more capital-intensive business. So J.B., I mean, there – there'll definitely be a residual impact from AWS. And as I had stated in my comments, as we sit here today, they have a higher than average, for the rest of our company, SG&A rate to sales. The new assets they are bringing up the collective number for the company. But we see opportunities to prove that and certainly as the purchase accounting impact of year one runs off, that will help out as well. So we remain optimistic that we are going to drive that rate down, and our goal continues to be to get back to 10%., Well, I think, J.B., there's lot of numbers – there's a lot moving around as you anniversary this contract., And let me – I'd just maybe before we keep talking, let me clarify a question that Eric Hugel had asked earlier because I think it relates to this conversation. So depreciation and amortization for the company -- and that's not all that's in SG&A, but it's part of it -- was 12.3 million for the quarter and for the year was about 39 million. Our expectation for 2011 is that depreciation and amortization will be a little over $60 million in fiscal '11. So you can see the big jump and that's again reflective of the CapEx as well as the purchase accounting effect, as well as the capital nature of AWS. I think in terms of – if you're looking for a pure run rate on that going forward, J.B., well, I'll have to give a little more thought to that and provide that – provide some inside information on that supplementally., Well --, Okay that is depreciation and amortization., For purchase accounting would just be the amortization., And you have a large asset base that you are depreciating that we've added to the company. I think maybe said differently, can you – the jump of – from 40 million annually to 60 million is that mostly driven by AWS. The answer is yes., Interest of – net interest of around 7.5 million a quarter, I think, is the right way to model it right now. Tax rate should be somewhere between 34 and 35%. So 34.5% I think is an appropriate effective tax rate. The volatility you saw really in 2010 was related back to our first quarter, where we had a kind of a peculiar accounting related to a leveraged lease transaction that was unwound, but I think it has been reasonably consistent since then., You're welcome., Stan, as we enter the year, Stan, I think, what I signaled is that we expect once again to be positive cash, generate some free cash flow from the business. At the same time, we are seeing opportunities for some pretty solid investments. We've kind of raised the bar in terms of what we want to see in the way of a return on our capital and we do see opportunities as we've been discussing to support this AWS acquisition, and we also see opportunities to support the commercial markets. So my sense is that there will be a kind of a combination, if you will, of investing in the growth of the business as well as continuing to address the debt repayments., Yeah, the free cash flow there might not be as – won't be as appealing, because we will be applying some of that cash to some deals., I think, Stan, really good about our businesses. I think as we sit here today on July, what? 14, 15, I – we feel we've gotten off to a good start for the year. We've had some contract awards and we feel good about our business., We feel good about the business., Yeah, but Stan, wait a minute. We always have butterflies in stomach. I've never gone away from butterflies in the stomach. I mean, that – that's still there., They are good butterflies and not caterpillars., Okay., Yeah, Larry, it's – it is all related and I – don't conclude that that's an annual run rate for AWS. Again, we have won some new business, and that new business is what triggered the asset investment. But yes, we are – our expectation of what I said earlier close to 60 for the year is, which is as you point out almost double of what we've seen in the last couple of years is entirely related to the AWS entity., So, it – that includes all the contract wins announced to date., There are – there is bid activity and proposal activity that could trigger more contract wins., The business has met or exceeded our financial expectations., No, the bid that we had – we have, we've elected the, the bids that were outstanding, we've elected not to pursue at this stage., And the things that we're focused on, we will be picking up at -- just within AAR., And we moved the capability to our defense systems and logistics business as well as what's embedded within the AWS business., Yeah., It's not dilutive Eric, it's not dilutive. It's just not at its, what I'd call, normal earnings rate potential. So we'd have to get past a year one hit. But we definitely don't see AWS as being dilutive this year., Well, the demand increases that we're seeing now are largely coming from our North American customer base, Eric., In the trading businesses I think that's where our – program business Eric, has some pretty good proposal activity from core – from customers outside of the U.S., Well, we're not full across all of the facilities, but we're starting to see this increase that I've been referring to. We're ready to – getting ready to announce a new customer at Indianapolis, which will take on another hanger or two, at least eventually. Miami, which has less long-term visibility, is the one as I said earlier gets hurt the hardest during the summer months but does get pretty busy during the rest of the year. And then Oklahoma City is pretty solidly booked. So we still have room, but it is definitely getting busier., I think Rick signaled that there is a couple of larger international air career opportunities on the supply side, supply chain logistics side for our commercial aviation, I should say. And we are stepping up our BD effort in the defense logistics area. There is a lot of focus right now on the KC-10 integration program that we've been talking about because it has interesting dynamics about it in terms of potential earnings leverages as we get over the initial phase. But there is a good pipeline of transactions, but not of the size of the KC-10., If you look at the blend of contracts that we had over the years, Mesa obviously is the real exception. And I think if you look at the recent transaction we had last year with Jazz we used very minimal amount of inventory to succeed in that transaction. In a couple of these different transactions that we are looking at today, one we are looking at with a partner where the partner will be providing the financing and we'll be providing the logistics and repairs, replacements, etcetera. And then one of the other international transactions that Rick alluded to, we will be using some of our balance sheet and the balance sheet will be utilized for – this would be very new generation equipment, 737-NG type of equipment. And so we have a high level of confidence in the quality of the assets and the affordability in the event that the customer itself should go through what a Mesa went through., The credit markets are still very tight. The aircraft changing hands is not as brisk as you'd like to see. So we've taken a position -- we continue to work down the investment. So the investment today is about 5 or 6 million less than it was last year at this stage. So we're looking at this as a kind of a holding period, if you will. It's not – there haven't been tremendous amount of opportunities to flip assets. We do have one of the assets is -- been pre-sold for delivery in -- later in '11, I believe fiscal year '12. So we were constantly looking for opportunities to keep working at it, that asset base down., We had some success in that regard. We could use in some of the – in cases, some of these assets we do require that they continue to stay on-lease longer before we can be in the position you just indicated., Good morning, Tom., Both. So it's insured and then we are operating under certain regulations, if you will, that protect us from our investment., That's correct. Right. That's correct, Tom. I mean we carry property insurance. And I mean just again to be clear, a good chunk of the fleet in this business is collateral for secured loans. So you can imagine that lender has gone through all the same questions that you've just asked. So it's a pretty tight structure in terms of the property coverage on these assets., It's a little hard to actually zero in on where we are in the cycle at this stage. My sense – our sense is that we could spend as much money as the U.S. government could print right now. And so we're kind of picking our spots, if you will, Tom. We are making investments. We are making investments at attractive level, but to Rick's point also, we are focused on playing in the game on the sales side. So the margin – the purchase price might be more attractive, but the selling price might be a little less than we – ideal. So my sense is we're still in the early stage of the recovery and you could spend as much money as you wanted to., About the same., Okay., Yeah, Larry; it's Rick. Yeah, I think we would expect the – to come down a little. I mean, not a ton, but I think it can come down a little bit on the top-line, but I think margins is where we would expect a little more impact as those come back a little bit towards more traditional levels., Well, we have – we have five heavy maintenance lines going. We have three mod visits in and the paint hangar going., It's getting closer, yeah., The contracts that we are purchasing the assets against have a longevity. I mean, these are five-year contracts with one – basically one-year contract – five-year contracts with one-year renewal. And we have recently spent time with USTRANSCOM Command folks to get a sense as to how they saw this supplemental demand continuing, and they feel that this is extremely vital airlift capability for a few different regions, one of which is cost effectiveness. So we for – for instance, we performs an air drop function that alternatively with a relatively small -- what's called CASA aircraft and we perform that service where the government would have to use a C-130 in its place and the C-130 would cost a lot more to operate for that kind of mission. So the kinds of mission that they have slated for us are of a supplemental nature, but also of a – taken into consideration the cost effectiveness in which we can deliver., So as we go out and acquire these assets, one of the things I'd mentioned earlier in this consolation, Tyler, is the need for simplicity within this operation. Keep in mind now, we've only owned this business for 90 days. So we're kind of in the last phase if you will what we call phase 1; we have kind of broken this transition into three phases and phase 1 is kind of been to normalize the business. As we get into phase 3 where we looking at commonality amongst our fleet. The two aircraft types -- the aircraft that we have been acquiring are not new aircraft types to the fleet; they're additive to the fleet, which means that are -- if you think of the Southwest business model around 737s and the simplicity, that's kind of where we're heading in terms of this operation., The two -- of the 20 aircraft, helicopters that are parked, there are two category aircrafts and it is our goal to exit from those two categories of aircraft. In the process of doing that, we have less training expense; we have less spare parts expense, less maintenance expense, and more simplicity., Tyler, just two follow-on comments to what David just said. I mean first and foremost, I mean I want to be clear that CapEx guidance we provided so far is a gross number. So it's not net of any expected proceeds on disposing of this idle fleet. So you circulate cash, and I want to be clear on that., The second is, I mean to be really clear because in your question you made it sound like it was perhaps a problem with these aircraft. I mean, when you look at the acquisition cost of these aircraft, plus -- and then compare that to the earnings they generate while they're operating and the expected residual value as we sell them, it's a great ROIC. I mean it's a great investment and that's the same kind of approach we take -- we've taken and we'll continue to take to these new investments in front of us. If the expected earnings power and considering a very conservative residual value make it look like a good return on the investment, that's the way we'll analyze it. So I don't -- nothing -- just because this fleet's idle, it shouldn't be construed as a problem., I think what I would say is our preference is to simplify the fleet structure. In the process of simplifying the fleet structure, the aircraft that are currently parked are better off exiting our fleet. And we believe there is demand; we know there is demand. We've had people come in and look at acquiring the aircraft. So it would be our preference at this stage to cash out of that fleet and that – essentially use that cash to finance additional lift under – with similar type of aircraft to what we currently are operating., Yeah., We really, Troy, like the opportunity we have around consignments. It does have, I'd say, a modest impact on gross margins. But obviously from a return on capital perspective it's very favorable. It's a wonderful way for us to support our customers, to participate in high quality assets without taking significant asset risk. The margin profile obviously is looking a little bit lower because of the – because you don't have the capital risk. We are looking for more consignment type programs with a variety of different parties. And as I said we think it's good business., If you look historically at the margins in supply chain, there's more volatility in that segment on margins than really the rest of the business over a longer period of time. And it's just because of the mix of business. I don't think that the consignments necessarily are going to have like a permanent negative impact on margins, and I think you'll still – you'll continue to see some level of volatility in margins in that segment., It's none of those, but going to your first question we expect the startup costs associated with the new aircraft and customers we inducted in the quarter to be completed. So the negative margin impact related to training and ramp up and efficiencies will start to, the benefit of the margin will come through in Q3, and then there will be some investment to support the new customer., What do you think you're missing?, A freight carrier., Let me inject here, if I may, Larry. It's David. I think what Tim is alluding to is that a portion of that business, which has a transaction orientation and we're seeing an increase in transactions. We had some transactions in this period that had lower margins than we'd like to see, but yet they had good cash flow implications and good customer service implications. So we went ahead and executed against those opportunities. So I think moving forward, I think what you're going to see is you're going to see margins – gradual margin improvement in that business., We had a surge, if you will, in sales this period, which we believe will continue. We've had an opportunity here. We've been talking about recovery in the commercial markets here for some time. I believe in this period you started to see some – what we expected earlier in the calendar year. And based on kind of the flow of action in the business, I would expect that to continue at this point, and I believe the margins will strengthen as the volumes start increasing here., Now the consignment piece I think as Tim indicated is good business. I mean basically we're not consuming our capital, and we are getting all the benefits of having access to the inventory without the risk of ownership let's say. So for that we take a little lower margin. Now the implications of that are obviously have some margin implication. But I still believe we still have a significant investment in our inventory, and we continue to see opportunities aside from consignments that allow us to go ahead and get more historical margins., Larry, I just want to just to append to it because it really really supports Troy's question too. The other thing I don't want you to lose sight of is the Amsterdam congress piece of what we've discussed., Don't just correlate the margin performance to consignment, that's not the message., As Amsterdam goes away you'll see some improvement in the margin., Absolutely., No, the aircraft transaction was a – aircraft that was owned through joint venture., So that's just, Correct., That's correct., We are starting to deliver on some engineering services contracts, but the growth is really broad based. We had increased revenues at all four of our MRO facilities and strength in engineering services., All of the hangers have aircraft in them today., That doesn't mean we're at capacity because there are ways to load more man hours into those hangers, but all of the hangers are under lease., It's progressing, we've had some relatively small wins, but we're still, we're progressing in our dialogue with them and hopefully we'll make some progress here in next few months., Hi, Ken., Yeah, these are not negotiations, these are responding to bids, There was a bid recently that we did not procure that we were not victorious on any of the aircraft, but we anticipate that as the year progresses there'll be some more fixed-wing opportunities as well., I believe there is the upside for wins. I'm not certain how much more we'll be able to go ahead and actually execute against in the balance of fiscal year because we've got a handful right now with the six airplanes – the six helicopters. They go into service and relocation and we have some traction on more mod work opportunities that we're exploring. So we – I think if you look at the order of backlog that we have, I think it's pretty appealing, pretty attractive and I'm not certain that we'll be looking to add much more on to that between now and May 31. But there are – you should know that there are still significant opportunities out there for additional growth., As the calendar year moves along so the induction of this aircraft is scheduled for January 20, and I would imagine that as the year progresses and we'll be judged on how we perform on the maintenance on the first aircraft. I believe that assuming that we execute in the way that we're capable of I would anticipate that a few months after that we'd be awarded the balance of the aircraft., There's a couple of aircraft coming out of the desert. We've seen some of that taking place, but I think mostly it's about utilization. There is some fleet growth with some of our customers, Southwest, I believe will be taking on some additional aircraft, and they have additional maintenance requirements this calendar year. So I think it's kind of a mix., Yeah., Well, Q3 is by definition our shortest quarter., You have the holidays obviously and then you have the month of February which, somebody figured out February should have less days and that part of this quarter. So we – so we see some of that in this quarter. So there has been seasonality to our business., Yes., I think $6.5 million., Yeah., We have a very strong and capable precision machining business as well as a composite development business. And to date, we've not seen the kind of revenues that we are hoping to see come from those businesses. Our leadership team led by Terry Stinson is aggressively pursuing ways to go ahead and expand the sales penetration on some identified targeted customers, and we have had some traction and we anticipate as the year progresses we'll have more success along these lines as well. And that in essence will give us a little bit more balance to our manufacturing capability and our structures capability, which today is heavily dependent on our mobility business., Now all that being said our mobility business is meeting its plan, slightly exceeding. We had last fiscal year a tremendous year in that business. We have a lot of high level of confidence that the business has – will continue to perform well and contribute very profitably to our business mix. With that being said we together with the leadership of that group of businesses would like to achieve more balance and see more business coming through our precision machining and composite capability., Yeah, I believe all aerospace related., So mostly commercial aerospace. They are some defense opportunities as well. That we're pursuing., Thank you., Hi, Jon., Meaning., For Amsterdam?, Well, I think as we said in our release, Jon, I mean this quarter we had had a $2 million pre-tax loss at Amsterdam., This quarter was a little uglier than what we would probably, typically see., And part of that is because we recognized some severance., For some early downsizing efforts we're starting to do there. But I think you can expect that when you annualize it, you're going to have a number somewhere around $5 million to $8 million of pre-tax losses probably., Well, let me clarify first. We've not signed a contract with Embraer. We're signing a contract along with a partner. We're signing a contract with a major air carrier., to support their fleet of Embraer 70 and 90-seat jets. And I think Jon it's a meaningful contract and we're particularly excited because it's a commercial contract that breaks through into a new platform that we haven't previously supported. But I think after we signed, actually ink the contract, then they will say more about the size of it., Yeah, yes and now let me just add a couple clarifying comments. We had entered the year with it was either seven or eight aircraft that were scheduled to have their leases come up for renewal this year. We had I think commented on previous calls or at least last quarter's call how a couple of those aircraft we had sent for disassembly. So we dealt with a couple, but the message now is with this last quarter we've dealt with all those aircrafts., So we no longer have any fiscal '11 expirations that we have to deal with and yes these were all re-leased and they were re-leased at comparable rates. So we're happy that we didn't take any real steps backward with respect to those economics., Thanks, Jon., Hey, Eric., Eric, how are you?, The latter, Eric, it's just the 6. I mean we're not out speculating on equipment, whole thing will be put under contract. So we won these contract awards, we acquiring the assets to fulfill those contracts. And yes to your point at our Investor Day we were still negotiating what the payment structure might look like for the aircraft. I wasn't sure some of that would slide out of the fiscal year, but I'm now expecting all of that could be by the end of the year., Well, it was 50 basis points on our operating margins., Why don't you let us get back to you on that., I mean, yeah, we can get back Eric, I think you can do the math too, based on the data we've done. I mean we've told you it's a $2 million operating loss and we've recognized almost just a little under $1 million of severance, which would have been in SG&A line., Yes., No, no write downs. Mesa continues to execute their restructuring plan and so we don't, we didn't take any write-downs there and we don't have anything hanging out there we think is eminent either., No, it's going to look more like our Jazz aircraft support contract, which is much lighter upfront investment., We'll rely a lot more on the inventory that the carrier already owns., Yes., Well, we are making good progress on the program, Eric. We're getting through some of the upfront issues that we encountered. We do expect our performance, financial performance to improve in the upcoming quarter and then to continue to improve after that, and I would say that we should be where we expected to be going into Q1 of next fiscal year., No, we're not. The bridge contract from BAE is over and the – we are delivering units for Oshkosh and so for the balance of this fiscal year we won't see any increases in off of this base. However, we are encouraged by some of things that we're hearing in terms of additional requirements going into the – our next fiscal year early., Yeah. The BAE bridge contract did help smooth it out. Yes., Thank you., I believe you will see continual improvement along the margin trail. So if you look at this period, if you add – take an asset into account, the operating margins is right around the 8% level and some of the other initiatives that we have going on the company will lead us to the steady improvement if we're up let's say on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Obviously that rate of improvement will slow down, as we get closer to 10. But I think you should continue to see gradual steps towards that 10% level., Yes, sure Stan. Let's I guess at real high level. We have 3 different tranches of convertible bonds. The first was a series that we have about 120 million of face value outstanding on is has a put call date in February of 2013. So still a couple of years out there. The conversion price on that is $29 and 40 something cents, it's somewhere in that range. And so that bond bears coupon at 1 3/4., 
            , Yeah, and David says just to remind everybody, the shares that that might convert into are already reflected on our fully diluted EPS. So if in fact that does convert, you won't see any incremental dilution off of that., The other balances, we have two other series. One that's due in, excuse me, that has a maturity in 2014. We have, the face amount of that is right around $80 million. I think we're down to – that's discounted. So we're closer to $100 million undiscounted. I'm sorry I don't have that in front of me right now, Stan, but anyway that's 2014 and then our final series is in 2016. All in the face of our convertible bonds is close to $400 million., The last two, we have an effective conversion price in the mid-40s. We had the bond itself converts $35.57, but we had put a what's called bond hedge around so it effectively increase the conversion price and it's into the mid-40s., Those two tranches are not in the current dilution, right., You're welcome., No, we have two aircraft that have been put back on lease that were not leases that had expired coming into the year. What we referred to earlier were the leases that had expiration dates this year, those leases – those were aircraft we had basically repossessed from a carrier about a year ago so those aircraft we're still on negotiations to place those aircraft., Yes., Good morning., Yes, the portion of that business, Tom, is inter-company activity that will be transferred to AAR businesses. There's a portion of the business that is – that we continue, we expect to continue to operate for the customers in Amsterdam. So there's a few different tasks that we go with Amsterdam, one of which is to sell the business, there's some interest in buying the business in which case those contracts obviously would stay with the business., Yes, there are other companies that look at some of this business and see ways for synergies that make investment in this business worthwhile., Yes, Tom, we have been actively marketing them. We have had expressions of interest around several of the aircraft, nothing firm yet but expressions of interest. And we are in the – people – potential buyers in the process of doing due diligence and we're doing paper work. And then several of the aircraft we've actually began to disassemble for parts. We see a reasonably strong parts market for some of this. So we have been active on it and our hope is – our expectation is before the year's out we will turn some of that into cash., Well, we have continued to do work on the A400M. The issue is really a function of the Airbus folks getting the aircraft ready for delivery to the customers and they continue based on that, and we are looking for deliveries to begin in calendar 2012 and then continuing where they get to a peak level in 2015., Thanks., The margins in Structures and Systems the change there is really directly related to the change in our mobility business. And as I have said earlier I think for the balance of the fiscal year at Structures and Systems you're going to see approximately the same level of performance., I mean Troy that's certainly our goal and so as we keep the sales levels up high I think that makes that goal a lot more achievable. But we've had a goal of being below 10. We're happy with where they are. Nothing unusual happened to bring that rate down this quarter. In fact as we said there was some severance booked that we shouldn't have to repeat so I think we feel pretty good about that level., Yes, David commented on that earlier, Troy. I think we made some progress. We've gotten some smaller orders from them, but the general pace of discussions and ramp up of our relationship with them is as expected. So it's not going to happen overnight, but we are happy with the progression we're making there., Well, that's about the size of the business now., Yes, but the real struggle for that business is in the summer months when whole fleets come out of maintenance. So but for the balance of this fiscal year that is about right., Yes, I think that's probably. We haven't had business for a full year yet. So we haven't had a chance to fully understand the ebbs and flows, but I would think that's not a bad way to look at it at this point., Larry., Could be a little bit on the high end – that might be a little bit higher than our expectations. There are some mod work business that's not duplicable., That comes out. So I won't be modeling it that high., I'd probably be thinking of maybe the run rate that you just referred to and maybe add on another 15 million a quarter approximately., No, we didn't., That's right, Larry, somewhere in that $35 million, maybe to $40 million, but yes., Eric, let me address the question on Iraq. We are aggressively pursuing the Iraq business as a process if you will. We're working right now with the State Department centric opportunity and we're working as I indicated fairly aggressively. I believe the re-branding exercise that we're going through will go a long way to re-instituting those opportunities. So if you we will begin – we have begun the relocation process and we will begin the re-branding with the name AAR Airlift beginning January 1., So I would anticipate that once we're off of the Blackwater property and fully operational down in Melbourne, Florida and with our new name that our visibility with the State Department will improve or our standing with the State Department will improve dramatically and lead us to being back as a qualified bidder if you will. They are very aware of who we are, what we're doing. They're very aware of our new leadership team. We had visited with the State Department on numerous occasions including myself, and we have been received very favorably. So I think that's just a matter of time quite frankly., In terms of opportunities inside in addition to Iraq and Afghanistan, we are pursuing numerous opportunities. I think we're trying to prioritize though all the different work streams that we have and the focus today is around putting the new aircraft into service over in Afghanistan, moving on with the relocation and being, getting established in Melbourne. We're very focused on the mod business and getting revenue streams come back on the mod business. So we're tackling that business from a lot of different dimensions, and we feel very good about where we're at in relationship to where we were when we acquired this business on April 7., I believe that if we're talking purely about Iraq, yes. So we have at this moment we are engaged in discussions with folks to sell some of those parked assets, but assuming that the asset is still under our control at the time that we would be awarded some work, many of those assets would be deployable., Yes."
1004,2011.0,Q&A,a,"Troy, you're talking about our Government and Defense Services segment?, Yeah. Yeah, I think what we've tried to guide is, it's somewhere between an 18% and 18.5% margins, so I don't want to quibble with you, but it's – in that zip code is what we believe is our steady state. Clearly, we're below that this quarter. And the color I could provide is just to reiterate what I said is -- we had -- margins are highly impacted by aircraft availability at Airlift, and being eligible to bill full amounts -- entitled to bill under the contract assuming the aircraft is available for use by the customer. When we have maintenance events, whether they'd be scheduled or sometimes unscheduled maintenance activities that takes the aircraft out of service that works against those in the contract and can lead to the opportunity for lower billings and when that happens that tends to have a high impact on margins., No. It's the former, Troy. Remember, the business model for the Airlift business is most of our economics are derived by having a available aircraft and available crew for the customer's use and then the customer decides how much they use it that usage does contribute incremental sales and incremental margin dollars but when we look at it on a margin rate basis, it's most sensitive to having the aircraft available., Yeah. That's our expectation., When engineering services has its kind of peaks and troughs, Troy, it's going to cost a little bit of variability around that, but I think the segment kind of has shown historical, when things are clicking we're usually anywhere between 14% and 16%. And I think that's kind of the store the same place you should assume., Yeah. Yes, Tyler, embedded in that number has always been an assumption about purchase accounting and we have to go through that exercise. And so as David alluded to, we're – that's – takes a while unfortunately. So we don't have a final picture on that. But we've made what we think is a pretty educated estimate and don't expect any material changes from that at this point in time. And so assuming that holds, then yes, that is definitely still our outlook for those businesses., Well, I said it was not material, Tyler and I just – you should equate that to kind of the $1 million or less zip code., Most of it is incremental. I mean, most of it is new activity. I'm not sure it all is. I think there may have been one of them. We talked about having a few under LOIs last quarter and I think one of these were – was under LOI at that time., Hi, Julie., It's still the plan, and we – now with numbers out, we have the ability to be a little more active in that regard. So, we're still expecting to term out the facility. Whether it's half or whether it's a little more than half, Julie, will be kind of a function of specific market conditions. But our goal is certainly to take some of what is now a pretty good bubble of short-term bank debt and term it out., No, Julie. It wasn't related to the Spirit work. The Spirit work continues to ramp, maybe a little bit slower than we had originally hoped. And we are incurring costs associated with that ramp, but we're still optimistic about the opportunity with Spirit and bringing on additional work in the third quarter and fourth quarter and then into next fiscal year., No, Larry. I mean in isolation, Larry, it will definitely be modestly accretive., Or that's our expectation. So, David gave a kind of a full picture in his comment about the outlook., But, yes, in isolation it's – it is. The business has very nice momentum right now., Larry, it's Tim. We see continued opportunity for growth in our Supply Chain business, both with some of the things that you're talking about, as well as some prospective new business as well as some pretty good demand for the parts in our key product lines. So, we're optimistic and encouraged by our prospects in the Supply Chain business., It's tracking to -- against our expectation. It is contributing. It's modest, but there is excitement around it and we think it's going to be an excellent program for the company., Yeah, I mean it's – the nature of the issue that we're talking about, Larry, is probably similar to what we've talked about since we acquired and we always have seen as an opportunity. But you have to start with recognizing the nature of the operating environment, these aircraft we're operating in, it's a very austere environment and the kind of operating profile that you might expect off of some of these aircraft parts is challenged by the harsh conditions. So, we had more maintenance events. We had a fair amount of maintenance events scheduled and then on top of that we had some unscheduled maintenance events, and that's what leads. So, we are continuing to refine our investment in spares and trying to position those spares in the most advantageous way possible to try to boost aircraft availability. But it's..., It's definitely – probably the most difficult operating challenge for that business., I think that's a very good way to characterize it., Yeah., We're – Ken, we're ramping up now a new engineering services contract, which will start to impact us beginning in the third quarter. You saw the decline in the top line second quarter versus last year and that was all related to engineering services., Each of the – we had good performance out of each of our heavy maintenance centers in the second quarter. The operations are clicking, the shops are fairly full and we expect the operational performance of the shops to continue into the third quarter and then we expect the benefit of the ramp up of the engineering services contract. So, I think the outlook for MRO as we finish off the balance of the fiscal year is encouraging., Yes., A little smaller, but similar, okay?, But to your point though, Ken, on headwind, just so everyone understands is you're right, third quarter of last year had a very significant contribution of engineering services. We don't expect – while we are ramping, we don't expect that much of a contribution in our third quarter that we're just starting here. And it will be a little bit of a challenge in Q3 for that piece of it, but that will flip in Q4., Yeah. I would say that it is a little early for us to start handicapping what's going to happen out of American. We hear the conversations, but I think there's still some time to go there. We do think that ultimately there will be some opportunity actually across our businesses, but probably not anything kind of in the very near term., I'd look for – Ken, this is David. I'd look for a greater opportunity in spare parts and component support world than I would in the airfreight maintenance world coming out of the American., So that – American is a relatively small account for AAR. I think you noted that when they filed for bankruptcy, they owed us about some $500,000. So for the size airline and the breadth of our capability, it's a fertile area for opportunity as we look forward., Yeah, so for start, Ken, it was 15%., It was without that. As Tim indicated earlier, Ken, he sees – we see continued very good momentum in that business. And I think should bode well for good year-over-year comparisons we think for the balance. But sequentially, I don't know if we'll have the kind of -- we have very good first quarter that was impacted by aircraft we have a little aircraft impact here. So, when you exclude those aircraft impacts, I think we'll see some sequential improvement as well but in general momentum it feels good in those businesses., Good morning Eric., Good morning., Well, we said – I said Parts Trading, Eric, as well as component repair., As well, so you should equate that to basically ex-aircraft., I think the program operationally is where it needs to be. We're performing for the customer, the customers delivering aircraft. And now it's a matter of continuing to drive efficiency, purchasing efficiencies on our end. And so with our Airinmar acquisition, they're helping take a look at additional opportunities for margin expansions. I'd say that we're not finished yet, Eric. In terms of kind of get into the plateau from a financial performance perspective but we do believe that we're performing operationally., The aircraft are generally performing very well. We did have a transmission issue towards the end of last quarter which caused the aircraft from that service for about a week. So it did have an impact on our availability. We did get some concessions and some support from Sikorsky which is not equal the impact to our earnings. But the aircraft in general, Eric, are performing very well., Clearly, it was a major hurdle and accomplishment for the business. It was completed in August. The transition took a fair amount of work and there was some pain associated with it. But now, that's fairly pretty much behind us. The issue around the maintenance was as some of these aircraft got into maintenance, we were anticipating 30-day turns. We end up in some cases with 60-day turns and just one of those things., I mean, airlines run at that quite frequently. We were a little disappointed with the turn times coming out of maintenance but nevertheless, we understand it. So the – and that impacted the results in the quarter. There will be some of that tailing into Q3. We should be – though as we come out of Q3, we should be in very strong position. Q3 also for this business is concerning that mostly aircraft are operating in Afghanistan. It's a tough environment during the winter months in Afghanistan, so the aircraft receive a little less utilization., But as we come out of the third quarter, the demand from the customer is more robust and the – our fleet should be in much better position. So the business is performing quite well. Still way ahead of what we had originally anticipated when we first bought the business. As we got into the business a little bit, we were hoping that we would get more utilization at this point in time that we just haven't been able to achieve, some of which was maybe unrealistic on our part. But as we move into second half of the year, this business should continue to perform very well for the company., Yeah, I think you're going to see relatively consistent performance into Q3, slightly up or slightly down. But I think as we go into Q4, I think you'll see a nice improvement in margins., No. You should expect good free cash flow over the balance of the year, Eric. You may recall, we've provided some outlook on that at our Investor Day as well and we're still projecting that kind of performance. So first quarter was as you're well aware, we were a big user of cash. We're nice – happy to see that improve dramatically on a sequential basis, but we still are – we still have a ways to go to get to our range that we had guided for the year, but we expect to get there., Thanks., Yeah J.B., I mean, what you're seeing is we have – we had I think a couple of challenges that we've described quite a bit on this call; one at Airlift and that Airlift not only impacted us in Q2, but also as we've said, will be with us probably into Q3 which is all around aircraft availability. And our precision machining business inside structure really helped put a dampening effect on margin performance in the quarter there and while we expect that to improve – those are a couple of variables sort of heading in the wrong direction., Telair is, Nordisk acquisitions – and Airinmar has always been a small acquisition, that's more of a capability play than it is contribution. But those two businesses are performing very well. We're not backing off of our expectations of those two businesses in any way. But when we talk about, they have a small stub period effect here for us this year. And when we think about a couple of those items I just mentioned heading the wrong way, I think we're – we'd just like to leave our guidance the way it is right now., That's correct., Our guidance for next year certainly assumes growth in the business., Thanks., Hi Jon., Well, Jon, it's a business, let's just start with – doesn't have a lot of CapEx requirements. So it should be – we should see cash flow – and as a result doesn't have a lot of D&A either. Small working capital requirements but basically what you predict for net income should be pretty close to its free cash flow contribution., So, I think that's the general model of that business. In terms of what to expect for that, I know we've talked a little bit about its top line impact and that it would be margin accretive. I don't – I think our preference is not to get too much more deeper into the specifics of the business at this point., Now, let me – I'm sorry, I apologize, Jon. I didn't – just at the risk of sounding – I don't want to confuse you because, that's the core business. Now we do have purchase accounting..., That's coming into play here and we do expect to have a fair amount of intangible assets that will be set up as part of purchase accounting that will have to be amortized., So, as that picture becomes a little clearer, we'll try to refine the message to you guys about marginal cash flow performance relative to income performance on that., Well, we've invested already, Jon. I mean, and it's not just parts. It's actually – it goes up the whole chain of large components that we invest in such as spare engines, spare gears, landing gears, things of that nature. David referred to transmission earlier but also frankly just whole aircraft as spares as well. So there's – you have a whole spectrum of what spares can look like and that can change the investment dollars quite a bit as well. The opportunity – it's a cost/benefit analysis that we're constantly doing for ourselves. I mean, we can size pretty specifically what the opportunity loss is, not being able to bill. What it takes to solve that or capture that is less easy to get your hands around because it's not only what you're investing in but where you place it., And then you have to wrap that around the operating profile of the business because you have a lot of unplanned activities that happen as well. So it's the core of the operational challenge. We've invest – we've owned the business a little over a year and a half. We've made investments in this regard already, and I think we've captured some of the opportunity that had been lost the day we acquired the business. But the business has doubled in size and it's doubled – it's also gotten more complex with more outposts that we're serving the customer at. So the challenge continues to -- it's a dynamic challenge that we continue to get our – trying to get our minds around., Yeah. I mean, it's definitely our goal, Stan. I mean, the key here is we are – we have a few more moving parts right now than we'd like to have, mostly external, but there are some internal moving parts as well. But I think for the most part, yes, that's still out there, we still have our plan, and we're still tracking in that direction., It will definitely help in that regard, yes., So, Stan, on the acquisition, if you take a look at the recent acquisitions which took place – the first one took place in October, and that was in the mid $20 million range and then the acquisitions we closed on December 2, where we spent $280 million, I mean, clearly, our focus is – our cash has been going towards these ways of growing the company. So, as it is, we're trying to figure out the right long-term solution around financing these deals. But for now, the cash from the business has basically gone towards paying for these acquisitions., Stock buyback was – we tried to have a – we've kept a policy of acquiring shares equal to the number of shares we issue for stock options, for stock grants, so we tried to be – over the years, we've tried to be consistent in that regard. We haven't necessarily gone after the shares for any reason other than that., That should not change, right., Yeah. We're here to maximize shareholder value. So, we obviously as a public company were interested in building shareholder value. The path we've taken today has been to round out our portfolio to have a good balance between Commercial and Defense capability. We – with the latest acquisitions, we've expanded our platform to not just let's say a focus on aftermarket activities, but now on OE activities and try to get into the build cycle., So, the company we believe we've diversified the portfolio in an intelligent fashion. We believe that over time we will create shareholder value. But, at the same token, similar to – I'm sure the folks at Goodrich that we have an obligation to – if there's any opportunities that come by our way and we will do that., My view is that all industry has a tendency to consolidate. I think that it's not uncommon over time for businesses to be bought and sold and industries to consolidate and in many cases then deconsolidate. If you look at our customer base, you take a look at the airlines, you've seen a fair amount of consolidation over the last few years and I would imagine that you'll see the emergence of some new carriers as market niches get created through those consolidations. I believe the same thing takes place in the supplier universe. So, with Goodrich being acquired from UTC, there will be some businesses within the Goodrich universe that UTC will probably look to divest. And I think that's an ongoing process in every industry., Okay. If you're asking me if we're a target, I'm not aware of any overtures, so could we be a target? I imagine it's possible., Okay. Thank you., I don't think so, Tom. I mean, it's clearly a factor. It's clearly a challenge. We're short welders for instance in North Carolina, but we've been working closely with local schools and training institutes to go ahead and fill the pipeline. We had some success. We anticipate we'll continue to have success. It's more of a factor inside of our Airplane Maintenance business, but we're fighting that good fight too. So, yeah, I think this is an issue. I don't think this is an issue for AAR, I think it's an issue for other people, again, not just in this industry but other industries too. There is a skilled gap – there is a mid-skilled gap that exists in this country., Yeah. I believe we can move the needle and we're working in that regard. So, I would expect that this company will continue to attract and retain very talented people., Thank you., No, actually, yeah, we're seeing a fair amount of activity. So the ad-hoc business has been strong, but also as the – looking at different program activity as well. So, yeah, we anticipate that – as the fleets grow and as the airlines look to get more efficient, I think they pretty much buy into the fact that we can add value there. So yeah, that's – I would anticipate over the next 12 months that you'll see some additional programs coming from the company., I think it's a steady improvement. There is some business that comes out from some service contracts that we had, but you will see an improvement in Q4., Yeah, Troy, part of what drives the answer to your question is actual flight hours. So you recall the basic business model is we get paid a good portion we get paid is related to positioning the aircraft in-theater for the customer, but another significant portion comes from how much they use the aircraft during the quarter., These aircraft just were placed over there, so we're still getting, I think it's still early to say how much use we'll see in this next quarter. But it is something you'll notice as you, as we go through the fourth quarter., Yeah, I'd start by let's get the right context. Since we've brought Airlift into the fold and aligned all the reporting on Airlift and also launched KC-10, we've bounced around within a pretty small range I think within 50 basis points on a margin basis. So it's – we're not talking about big swings here. And if you did the actual dollars that equate to those small 30 to 40 basis point swings, it's pretty small in absolute terms., So there is – you have to start with the right context. But having said that, yes, we do believe there's upside opportunity from KC-10. It's coming a little slower than we expected, but there are definitely signs of improvement there, and we will see lift as we deploy these new aircraft for Airlift and get some operating efficiencies out of these new aircraft hours. That's why we do remain very confident that the segment margins will head north., I think you'll begin to see it next quarter, Troy, but it'll certainly be – it's not – there's not a silver bullet, so it'll be something to see throughout fiscal '12 as well., There's a fair amount of energy, Troy, this quarter on the relocation. So, I think getting the team all under the same roof, which will be completed here before the month of April is out, will be real positive for the operating efficiency of the business., Hi, Larry., Hi, Larry., We have not to-date. We have not seen any tightening in spending. We're keeping a close eye on that obviously, but we have not seen a tightening in spending., I would just add, Larry, February was the strongest month of our quarter by far, and March to date has not shown any fall offs., Yeah. Which quarter are you referring to?, Yes, that's right., Well, as I said, we're – the facility that we've been living under we put in place four years ago, Larry. We're a much bigger company now than we were when we launched that. So, part of it, that's because natural evolution, but part of it is, yeah, we want to be well positioned for the growth we think we have access to ahead., We had – I'll let Tim comment on efficiencies. But I would just say, yeah we deployed those aircraft at the very end of the quarter and as a result of that we're eligible for what's called the deployment fee. So there's a little bit of revenue in there, it's a modest amount but there is a little bit in there. That, as I mentioned during Troy's question, as we ramp that up now into operating service, we'll get a bigger impact off of that business., I believe that the disposition will be determined in the next – no later than six months from now as to whether we will be looking to sell or retain and reposition assets elsewhere within the company., Tyler, it's Tim. Utilization at Indianapolis is high. All of the hangers are under lease, so well they all have aircraft in them. They're not fully utilized, and we're taking some actions to modify some of the hangers so that we can get actually more utility out of them. So we do see opportunities for more revenue and efficiency coming out of Indianapolis., In terms of your first question, part of the concept we talked behind the MRO business is to drive ancillary revenues, including engineering services, including the backshops, third party, prepare field service work, and there is margin opportunity in these kind of ancillary services and that some of the things we've benefited from in Q3. We expect to continue to benefit from the ancillary services. We expect to continue to drive margin improvement in the core MRO business. But you're going to see volatility because some of these larger ancillary services or programs are a little bit lumpy. So we're continuing to focus on margin improvement. I wouldn't commit though to the levels that we experienced in Q3, on a going forward basis. We'll see them again but not necessarily every quarter., Yeah, that's correct, we're wrapping it up. Right., Tyler, we have received work from Spirit. We're in the process of developing the manufacturing protocols. We're programming the machines. We're buying the metal. And we expect that in fiscal 2012, we'll start to see the benefits of the work from Spirit., There's a variety of different programs and different parts that we're manufacturing and we continue to, yes, see opportunities for more?, None. No. Same as we left you with last year, last quarter., Thanks., Hi, Ken., Yeah, it's fair to say, Ken, if you go back to this call last quarter, I think we had thought at that time that we expected the back half of the year, meaning third and fourth quarter to be essentially around the sales levels we had experienced in Q1, Q2. So the third quarter wound up being lower than we expected and it was a variety of things that contributed to that. One was our large customer did a product switch on us early in the quarter, which led to some delays and then some – it was a choice for them and it led to some delays in putting out any product and then the product that they did take from us was lower value than what we thought we'd be making. So that was one reason., There was a couple of other things that impacted it, but I think the punch line is third quarter was a little lower than we had anticipated it. So, as we look to Q4, we expect to get back to where we thought we were going to be., Well, you know the Structures and Systems chronology, Ken, just to be clear is, if you went back in time two years ago or so, this was regularly a segment that had gross margins in the 15% to 16.5% range. And so, in our last fiscal year, fiscal 2010, we really saw some explosive margin growth in the segment. And that was due, in large part, to some things that were related to efficiencies that we thought we – would be recurring and would be sustainable for us., But some of it was just some very favorable one-time events. We had gotten some very good input cost breaks, you may have remember us talking about last year. So we had some very, very favorable mix of, I think product mix, costs and some efficiencies that contributed to significant improvement in gross margins last year., We've been saying for a while now, we expected them to come back down, and it was a question how far down they'd come. And we think they'll settle in above the old historical norms and I think that's what you've seen for the last couple of quarters. Now, we've been in this 18%, a little over 18%. We don't want to see that changing any time real soon, but we obviously it's a manufacturing business that has to deal with rising commodity cost and things like that as well. So we'll continue to keep you abreast of that as we see it evolving., It will be accretive to our margins for the business certainly and probably in line to slightly accretive to the margins for the segment., Yeah. Why don't I let Tim start on some of that., Okay. Ken, in the Supply Chain business you've always had fairly significant volatility in the margins just based on the opportunities in any particular quarter. They review the consignment programs, there's a wonderful opportunity to satisfy our customer's requirements and there's a modest impact on margin because we don't have the carrying cost and the , But I think the larger driver is more of the nature of the Supply Chain business where supply and demand fluctuate between quarters and margins go along with that fluctuation. So I think it's really not structural as much as it is more transactional., I didn't, but we had – it was roughly, it's roughly in the 6.5% range., No., Right., We haven't seen any. Our assets are deployable, are deployed. We have some assets as you recall that came out of Iraq that some need to be serviced. But at present, we haven't seen any surge requirements for coming out of those theaters., Great., Thank, J.B., Hi., Yeah, we are in – we've had discussions with Sikorsky, we've had discussions with the State Department, we're very familiar with that piece of business that you're referring to. So it would be ideal at some point for the State Department to outsource that work at this point. They felt the necessity to control the assets and to perform the service on their own. So that's something that we're chipping away at., No. Alex, yeah, this year's CapEx has significantly increased because of the growth aircraft we've been buying for the Airlift business. So let me maybe parse your question. So maintenance CapEx for us would be significantly south of where it is this year. Probably historically, we had about $30 million annually in CapEx and the Airlift business probably increases that maintenance CapEx number by $10 million to $15 million or so a year. But it's in that zip code of $40 million to $50 million would be the maintenance number. So if there are more growth prospects we decide to pursue next year, then that number could change, but that would again all be in the name of growth., Sure. Stan, we have an elaborate internal load map that gets us from where we currently are to the 10%, and there are lots of moving factors if you will. We have – it is a major driver here at the company. We believe that – obviously, if you take a look at the revenue base that we're currently generating, if we can get a couple of more margin points obviously, you can figure it, you can do the math and figure out what it means to our earnings profile., So there's some of it is along the lines of what you're talking about, SG&A normalization and some of it's amortization from deal amortization that goes away. Some of it is loading within maintenance operations, as we get an improvement to the commercial markets, we should see some lift in our parts operations., So when we survey the landscape we have a series of measures that we are initiating as well as monitoring quite closely. So it would be our anticipation that we should see constant improvement, steady improvement and then as some of the structural things go away, we obviously get a natural pick up there as well. So we feel we have a plan, and we're on path and hopefully we get there sooner than later., Sure. We continue to focus on generating cash from the business and you'll see in the quarter that just ended we generated $30 million approximately of cash from the operation. You'll also note if you look at the balance sheet closely that receivables have gone up, fortunately most of those receivables are with the U.S. Government. So we anticipate collecting on those receivables here in Q4, giving us a strong cash flow from operations period here as well. Now we have been investing in the assets that we've acquired for Airlift. We've added six assets in the quarter that just ended. We paid for the smaller assets, but we, yes, we will be paying in Q4 for the two newer assets that we acquired from Sikorsky., So when you look out there'll continue to be an emphasis on generating cash from the business. I'm not – at this moment we're not anticipating additional or any significant investments in our Airlift business, but that can change as a result of the opportunities that come in front of us. We do have a debt repayment this quarter, $42 million bond payment goes – gets taken care of this quarter. And that – the interest rate is approximately 8%, so that'll go away, so we'll use the cash proceeds to take care of that., So I think we continue to look at cash as a valuable asset to us and turning our assets into cash is something we're focused on. And generating cash position is important to us so that we can go ahead and feed our businesses and grow the company., I feel the market conditions are improved. I believe the company's position is stronger. So when I add those things up, yes, I feel better about where the company stands today than it did a year ago, yes., Well we are in that process today, Stan, we have stayed away from outlook for the most part. But we are, first of all, we're in the final throws we're – not the final throws but the middle throws of that ourselves. We'll be in a position to discuss some of that with our board at our April board meeting, and we'll have a much clearer visibility from the May timeframe. I'm not sure how at this stage at least how we'll look to share that, but first step is for us to get a handle on how we see things and figure out how best to communicate that., Thanks, Stan. Appreciate it., Yeah. I guess what I'd say, Tyler, is reiterate something I said a little while ago, which is I think third quarter was lower than we expected., So we don't expect to necessarily make up that amount, but we do expect fourth quarter to return to what we thought would happen. So that's probably a long winded way of saying, yeah. The October 6th guidance is not something you should stick too closely to and I think we probably will come in a little lower than what was predicted at that point., Okay., Hi, Julie., Good morning., Yeah. Basically you have, in the commercial space, you have four players, Goodrich, Ancra, Telair and AAR. Ancra and AAR are the principle – play principally in the converted market and Goodrich and Telair play in the original equipment market. Telair is on the Airbus A330, A340 and soon to be produced A350. And they recently won the 747-800. Goodrich would be on the 777 and the other aircraft that would have cargo systems., So, I believe Telair has a very good position. Combined with AAR I think it'll give us a real formidable position in the market. And then I think we'll both be able to learn from each other. I think we'll be able to learn and help us on the military side. And I think our military experience will be able to help them on the commercial side., As we said earlier, Julie, today, the business has about 60% of its revenue from systems and components that go into some of those systems and the balance with aftermarket parts and servicing. We expect with production rates increasing over the next several years that more and more will come from the system sales. But obviously, as the installed base gets bigger in the market, then our aftermarket opportunity gets bigger as well., Yeah. The conversion business is a very small piece of the business., But there is a conversion business. And keep in mind also, AAR has a conversion business., We both produced 767-300 systems, but they're different 767-300 systems, different applications. Thiers would be a more power-generated system. Ours would be a more labor-generated system. What I mean is their system have powered rollers, ours do not., Hi, Larry., That business has actually performed well through the last downturn. I mean they clearly experienced a decline in sales as with most people., But they've performed fairly well and they maintained a very high level of profitability. And they've come out of that downturn very strong. Their sales growth on a trailing 12-month basis, as Rick alluded to, is in excess of 20%. And yeah, I think that they have a nice little – strong backlog and a good visibility on sales and production and support rates going out here in the future., Yeah. My sense is that right now, we'd look to digest this deal. As you recall, we also closed on the acquisition of Airinmar, a couple of weeks back ago. So, our supply chain guys are busy on that integration. One of – the real advantage to this deal I want to think about is we recently announced the distribution agreement with Unison., And we have an established distribution network around the world. And having an opportunity to bring more content to our distribution capability is a real strength for the company. And in this regard, the distribution margins are not quite the same as the, let's call it the IP, the margin associated with the IP. And so on this opportunity, we see this as playing into our strength of having distribution capability and being able to acquire some IP capability to give us a higher margin throughput on things we distribute. So, I think that's the way to look at this deal., Yeah., You have a very well-run business and you have opportunities for synergy I think that we've indicated would be that you have two complementary markets being served. They have the technology around the commercial markets. We have technology around the military market. We believe as we bring these people closer together and collaborate with each other that there'll be certain synergies that'll be driven from that. We also believe that there'll be purchasing power synergies., We also see synergies in that Telair, to their credit, have focused largely on design and new products and new technologies where I believe they do have a leadership position in the world. And I think that when you look at our back shop and you look at our precision machining capability for instance, we think there's some offload opportunities there where they are currently contracting that, manufacturing work to others that we believe AAR can capture a meaningful piece of that production spend., So, I think those are the areas to look for and I think you're taking the best of class from the two different market groups, let's say, pull them together and we're hoping some good things come out of that., No, Tyler. We don't want to get into that situation. As David said – I mean look, we're telling you the areas that are there to us. And just to repeat, I think it's around the in-sourcing opportunities. These companies are largely design and integrators. So, there's a lot of actual production capability that we have and some aftermarket support capability that we have. So, we see some in-sourcing areas. We definitely see some cost avoidance and some engineering synergies around our A400M program that we'll be able to take out as well., And we have some scale benefits that we think we'll realize. But it is – they are very well-run companies and we don't want to mess them up. So, we're going to proceed in a way that we think makes sense. So, we'll get into the business more and as those opportunities get closer to realization, we'll give you guys more updates on that at that time., Well, we have good visibility on production expectations for the platforms we're on. We have some assumptions for some conversion work. It's modest, but there are some assumptions for that. And then we have some aftermarket assumptions as well, Tyler. So, I mean I think it's a more predictable aftermarket business than some of our supply chain businesses are today. So, in that regard, it has more visibility. But those are the variables we had to consider for that revenue estimate., I think a little more on the systems side as the installed base gets bigger. It is getting a little more towards the aftermarket numbers growing a bit, Tyler. But it's not a radical shift if you just go back a few years., Hi, Ken., Yeah. Let me just say that the aftermarket margins are much healthier than the original system margins, which I think would be typical of this industry, the OEs with proprietary rights., I believe so, yes., Yeah, I mean in the magnitude – I think it is clearly, it's higher, Ken. But I mean when you say the magnitude, the difference and I'm not sure what your reference point is necessarily, but I mean it's not as extreme as, let's say, some of the engine manufacturers. But it's up there., Yes., Aftermarket would be a lever that would have that potential could afford growth there, Ken, and then also conversions., Pricing trends?, On parts?, I mean their margins have held up nicely. So, I think the best we can tell, Ken, is that pricing really hasn't changed a lot. I mean they enjoy a position as an OEM and so they get the opportunity to modify their catalog list price on an annual basis. But margins have been holding up pretty consistent., Yeah. One of the keys of this business is you have very strong engineering content and you have a team based in Germany that's very focused on product improvement over the lifecycle of the product. And they have done some great things with the powered roller for instance, which is a high dollar value item inside the aircraft. They've made tremendous technological advances. And I give a lot of credit to their engineering team and the work that they've done and I think within that allows for strength in pricing., Good morning., Hi, Eric., Yeah, I think that's a good starting point. I think if you then go back to the first part of your question is that we will have purchase accounting effects that will work against that on a GAAP basis. And we have to do our purchase account evaluation there. So, it's a little premature to put a number out there. But we have modeled in and included in our $0.20 to $0.25 estimate a pretty significant impact from purchase accounting amortization., To the best of my knowledge, yes., Thanks., The area where we're making systems that are part of what's considered seller furnished equipments or the standard part of the new model aircraft, that's a life of the program position, Jon., Yes, that's possible. There are design costs that have to be incurred. Obviously this firm has matured for a while. They've done a lot of design work over quite a long period of time. So, they try to leverage a lot of their existing capabilities. So, just by reference, their design costs don't look anything like the amount that we've put into the A400M system for instance. But yes, as they incur those, they expend some and has the ability to – it could adjust margins., Well, John, I guess for the first part of your question, we're going to size according to what we think is a good transaction for the company and what market conditions look like. So, I'd say what we've modeled in here is taking about half of the debt and terming it out. And then we've applied a market rate to that. So, I mean we are not, as you know, we're not an investment grade credit. So, you can get a pretty good sense of what pricing looks like in any of the markets for our credit., John, Telair does conversion work., Yes, I believe so. We're really at the opposite ends of the spectrum in that the Telair System is a more comprehensive system than the AAR system. But there were buyers for both type of systems. Lower cost solution would be AAR. More comprehensive solution would be Telair., I mean with respect to the fiscal '13 number that we put out there, J.B., there's not a real big change in the mix for that number versus what we have just told you. They look like on the trailing 12 basis. So, again, roughly 60% of the sales volumes is happening from system sales and components of support to system sales and the balance from the aftermarket, So, as we look ahead to fiscal '13, that doesn't change dramatically as you play out over time. Again, your installed base is always growing. So, that should feed more aftermarket. But as you get through periods of high production rates on some of the platforms we're on, you'll see that number skew in those windows of time., I think when you have a chance to meet the management team from these businesses, I think you'll see they're quite excited about joining the team from AAR. Terry Stinson has spent a fair amount of time working with the leadership of the new businesses. And I think what you'll see is you'll see some exciting things coming as a result of that combination., Yeah. Thank you., Thanks, J.B., Yeah. Nordisk is obviously a leading business in the container and pallet business. They have a great position outside of North America. They have very little business right now into the North American market. It's one of the areas where we think we can provide some added balance. The business is not as exciting, I would say, as the Telair business and that the margin element is not as appealing. But when you look at what these businesses look like three years from now inside the AAR portfolio, I think you'll see much larger percentage coming out of the Telair piece than you would from the Nordisk piece., And just to give you a frame of reference on that, Julie, Nordisk is roughly 20% to 25% of the totals that we've been talking about for the combined businesses., Yeah, they're a little less on an EBIT basis, correct., Greg, yes. I believe the model works. The only difference I would see is that some of the production will go through AAR shops as opposed to other peoples' shops., Very much so., It's a strong part of their business., Yeah., Troy, let me just try and give a little bit more color on MRO. As Rick mentioned, the first quarter is always tough as customers don't want their aircraft in maintenance, yet we have a strong schedule in front of us, so we need to protect the workforce. It's exacerbated a little bit because we had a couple of mature, higher margin programs wind down, and basically replaced the plus from a top line perspective with new programs that are immature from a margin perspective., We're extremely excited about the new win, one in particular, a regional operator, five lines of work. It's a long-term contract and it's really very exciting. The rest of the shops are going to be busy here starting in September. The Engineering Services business kicks in later in the fiscal year, so there are a lot of very positive things going on. It's just that this first quarter had a lot of moving pieces. I will say also that we're positioned to add capacity for MRO if we need to. There is efficient capacity out there., So the year-over-year comparison is a little tough; I recognize that. But the outlook for the business is good. We're continuing to fill up the hangers. We're continuing to win new business. We're continuing to expand our brands and leverage our position. So it's a – as we look out, we're very positive about our performance., We've been working with Virgin for a while. We started out doing some integration work. It's migrated to check work. And we expect that there – at least there's no reason why we wouldn't be doing work for Virgin, whatever their requirements are, beyond the 18 months. I think the 18 months is just limited to the current volume of maintenance that they have in their hopper., We expect to continue to support them., Yes., I think more and more, price is always a factor, obviously. But I think our quality reputation is a differentiator. Our balance sheet is a differentiator. I would characterize the pipeline as robust. And that's why I made my comment about the potential for additional capacity. So we're positioned to continue to win business, grow and expand; and then most importantly, leverage that into other parts of the business., Hi, Larry., Your math on $2.5 million is a little high, Larry, but you're in the zip code. And yes, there's some incremental SG&A, but it's not a lot, so it flows down to operating profit. And then when you say bottom line, it certainly doesn't flow down..., The production line on that was not linear. It's ramping right now though. So that is a big piece of – not the only piece, but certainly a big piece of our outlook when we say we expect both sales and margins to ramp throughout the balance of the year., Yes, your commentary – I'm not sure if you're referring to MRO or our Structures but I'd say that..., The theme is the same, Larry. That's right. So you're obviously listening to what we had to say, and yes, I mean the theme is we expect sales and performance to improve in both of those key areas., Hey, Larry. It's Tim. What I would say is that it's robust. I mean you saw it in our overall sales growth to Commercial customers. We're seeing it on the spare parts side, we're seeing it on the program side, we're seeing it on the MRO side. So I think it's robust., Yes, no. I mean, no, you read about the changes, you read about some of the fleet planning that's going on., But it – from our perspective, we continue to talk to them about ways that we can add value and be important suppliers as they go through some of these changes that they're going through., Good morning, Tyler., Yes, four LOIs, Tyler. And we said through the second and third quarters., It's a mix. One of those four is an aircraft that we own outright. The other three are joint venture aircrafts., The sales level will be significantly lower. Part of the reason we had the sales as high as we did this quarter is because of the type of aircraft. It was a very large aircraft, so that is – that will be significantly lower, single-digit millions, and we would expect the profit contribution to be a lot lower too., We have firm requirements from the customer with delivery schedules, and it continues to ramp through the fiscal year. So we don't see significant risks to that revenue., No, through the end of this fiscal year., I think there are conversations with key customers about additional requirements. So those conversations are happening, but I wouldn't characterize them as being much more than inquiries. So I couldn't say that we feel like there are significant increases or even replacement going beyond the end of the fiscal year at this point, but there are conversations., But Tyler, I'd just like to add. If your question is just about Mobility, I think Tim has addressed that. But in terms of the segment broader, recall a part of our strategy there is recognizing Mobility is not going to grow forever is we've been emphasizing some of the other businesses in that segment. So as our Cargo System business starts to ramp up, particularly on A400M production, as we continue to build out this relationship with Spirit through our Precision Machining business; just as examples, those other legs of the Structures and Systems stool will continue to rise., Yes, so Tyler, when we talked about a year ago, we were producing nothing and we had nothing in backlog for that relationship. A year later, while it's not impacting our current numbers in any meaningful way right now, we have $100 million of booked orders through them. Now that stretches over several years going forward, but it's indicative of the progress I think we've made in the last year. And it's also indicative that the opportunity can get, can continue to grow off of that., It's a mix of platforms., Mostly across the Boeing fleet. And yes, you've got a mix of the different aircraft. But we'll get into further detail on the Spirit relationship at the October Investor Day., Great., Good morning., Hey, Ken., Yes, so I think we are doing a decent job there in terms deployment of the fleet. We continue to see opportunity for more efficiency there. As we've recently completed the move from North Carolina to Melbourne, we are now undertaking a program to bring a broad range of efficiencies to the business, and fleet deployment being probably the biggest opportunity but certainly not the only opportunity. I guess what I would say is we're probably halfway where we think we can be where we could have been when we acquired the business. So we made some progress and we see I guess a significant I would say opportunity for additional improvements., I think..., We've been very focused on retaining the business that we have today and digesting some of the assets that we acquired last fiscal year, and that's going to be our focus as we go forward. We are looking at opportunities that will give us a little bit more diversification. But I would say our focus is to generate cash out of the assets that we have, continue to drive for efficiencies, and continue to look for better yield out of the business. There are some opportunities for mod work that leverages our internal capability, and we're going to continue to pursue those. As you may recall, that was a significant contributor to the performance of the business before we acquired one contract in particular, so we see opportunity there., Ken, I'd also pile on that. Recall the last two renewals we announced, there were some growth aircraft in those as well, and those will be deployed throughout the year. So we have two fixed-wing and one rotary-wing growth aircraft that have already been teed up through those renewals., So you're right, it's good business and we're good at it. And we need to have a broader customer base and a broader capability there. We're taking some steps to do just that. We have won some business with one particular customer. We have some opportunities, some international opportunities. But it's a focus of ours to go ahead and expand this business so that it's a four-quarter business instead of the lumpiness that we've seen. But it's good, solid business, and we're working on expanding it and building in our franchise., I think that we're going to see some of the benefit in fiscal '12 for the one major program, but I don't believe it's going to be as much as we had in fiscal '11. I think it's going to – the big piece is going to flip into '13, unless there's something new that comes up., Right. So Ken, just putting a little color on that, I mean, we – in fiscal '11, close to 10% of the segment's revenue was from that type of activity. That's probably closer to 5%, between 5%, 6% this year based on what we see in front of us right now., Good morning, Eric., We did not provide that. It will obviously be in our Q, Eric, but I mean, we'll save you the drama. It's – we used – we did use cash this quarter and invested. It's pretty customary that in the first quarter we do some inventory buys and what not. We used approximately $25 million in cash in operations during the quarter., A little bit on Unison, a little at our Mobility business in preparation for the production ramp there., And a little bit to support what was a pretty strong demand on our trading businesses., We were up, as I said, about 150 basis points to normalized, Eric, as I've said. It's hard to say we'll continue that level exactly, but as we look out through the rest of the year, we would expect to be up 18% or above for the rest of the year. That's our expectation right now., Yes, well the reason I characterized it, Eric, in my comments that it was large – it was a little bit better than this period last year, but largely consistent with the average for last year. Yes, as you've noted, you have – you do have a little bit of quarterly ups and downs that can probably range about 100 basis points or so., And that has a lot to do with how much the customer is using the aircraft during the period, so what the demand is and incremental usage we can get off of that. Sometimes that can be impacted by deployment of aircraft during a period. There are deployment-related fees that happen that irrespective of how much you flew it. And some of it can just be on availability., So if you have a really good availability quarter relative to another quarter, that can have an impact as well. So that gives you a little color on what drives some of that variability. But you're essentially, I think, plus or minus, let's say, 150 basis points in any quarter., I would say that we're still working through the integration of the aircraft. It's a new aircraft to us. It's a new aircraft to the customer. And I don't think that we've actually reached maximum efficiency yet., Let me just say if I may, Eric, that the aircraft – the customer loves the aircraft. So you have – it's an air-conditioned aircraft, very comfortable interior and performs exceedingly well. During the period, there were some early technology or new technology aircraft issues around the engines and some of the major accessories and together which of course we were working through those., And we should have more deployments this quarter than we had last quarter. And hopefully as the aircraft gains a little bit more experience, Sikorsky gains a little bit more experience and the support package that we've already – that we've acquired from them can provide more liability for the aircraft, but not uncommon for a new technology aircraft operating in a new theater. You have the same thing on the commercial aircraft universe as well., Yes. I think as the year progresses, we should get more utilization from the aircraft and you should see better performance from the – from those aircraft, yes., Again, Eric, I think fourth quarter was a quarter where lots of things were going well. And again, the variables I talked about tended to all go in the favorable direction. I think there's upside as we've said both on getting the S-92 up its maturity curve and then also just in general with getting our aircraft fleet at a higher utilization. And we've made pretty good investments in inventory spares, et cetera, to try to support that goal., So I think the upside lies there. But I don't think you should draw the baseline of Q4; I think we should look at the average for last year and say that's the baseline on which we're going to try to improve from., Yes, I mean the answer is yes that there is upside, but it's important to recognize today Mobility continues to dwarf the other businesses in that segment., If we look longer-term, we should see that impact shifting a little bit, but with Mobility representing anywhere from 75% to 80% of that segment, it's – it becomes – it's still the major story. So, yes, there will be some upside in those other areas, but in terms of moving the needle, Mobility has the biggest driver on that still., Thanks, Eric., I think the process of getting from LOI to close is inherently unpredictable sometimes, J.B., so it's tough. I can tell you, as written, we would expect probably all of them to be done in Q2. But I think we're – one of the transactions is, or actually two of them, are close to the end of the quarter, so they could slip to Q3., Yes, only one of those four aircraft is an owned aircraft, and you only get the sales treatment off of an owned airplane. The JV, whatever P&L impact there is from the JV aircraft will flow through the JV line on our P&L., Yes, let me start. I think we feel very good about our SG&A, J.B. I mean I want to – I guess we wanted it to be clear that in part, the rate as published, which is 8.7%, does benefit a little but from the aircraft transactions. So when we did talk about excluding those aircraft transactions, that gets you a rate of 9.4%. That compares to 9.8% for all of last year. So I think that we do feel pretty good about where we are SG&A and it's not an accident we've gotten there. We've been very focused on streamlining our costs, and again, with the growth in the business, we're getting some nice leverage., Yes, eventually, as you grow, you have to backstop that with a little bit of SG&A support. So I do think the ratio is important. But the way we manage it day-to-day is on an absolute basis for sure., And on a year-over-year basis, we had very, very modest growth in absolute dollar spend., A little bit, that's right., You're welcome., Hi., That still remains our goal. Obviously, the environment today is maybe a little bit different than it was a year ago now in terms of the overall global economy, the Commercial airplane market and its impact on Commercial markets. And then of course, defense budget spending and so on. So we will continue to move the portfolio in that direction so that the business looks like a 10% or better operating margin business. And clearly as this year progresses, the margins will improve off of the 7% that we experienced in Q1., What we'd like to do, Stan, at the October Investor Day, what we plan to do is lay out our view in let's call it a balance of the fiscal year vantage point and then out into the future what our plans look like. So yes, it's still a goal out there. Clearly, this quarter we came off the progress that we had been making. But nevertheless, we do believe that as the year progresses, the margins will improve., No, no, no, there are ongoing efficiency drives throughout the company. I think Rick has alluded to the inefficiencies that we experienced in MRO, some of which is mix-oriented, some of which is new customer-oriented. So it's not so much that the costs necessarily will come down as much as the efficiencies will improve., And we have similar dynamic at our Mobility business. We are looking at efficiencies. I think we've signaled as well the – with the move behind us with the Airlift business, we believe there may be – the management down there believes in maybe certain opportunities to drive more efficiencies through that business as well., So that at AAR is an ongoing part of our life and I would expect that we'll continue down that path. I think Rick also in talking about the SG&A level being down at 9.4% is a pretty appealing level for the company. So if we can sustain that through the balance of the year, I'd view that as a real positive., I'm not so certain that we'll put more parameters around it than we have. I think we've indicated that we'll continue to drive those efficiencies, Stan, and I think you'll just continue to see us perform in that fashion., Yes, I believe that you'll be looking at both. I think you'll be looking – we are looking at a couple of different properties towards the goal of improving our operating margins. And at the same token, short of being able to get deals done at the right pricing levels, we will pay down debt with the cash., We've already put in place the dividend. Obviously, we'll look at the dividends each quarter at the Board level and determine whether that current level is appropriate or increases our best hand. But I think for now, I would anticipate that they use the proceeds will be to look for good strategic assets that fit our portfolio as well as if unsuccessful in that regard, then pay down debt., Yes, we're expecting cash – we're expecting good cash performance, similar to what we've had in the last few years. We expect a little bit more free cash. Rick has talked about the CapEx being at $70 million. We already spent $40 million in the first quarter. So if you look at the pace of CapEx through the balance of the year, it will be less intensive, so therefore that in and of itself will generate some cash., I think what Tim is alluding to is that there are opportunities to expand if we so desire. We're again extremely focused around margins and the implications of margins. There is some space available in Indianapolis, but there are also a couple of very attractively priced facilities. Keep in mind now Indianapolis is the Taj Mahal, if you will, of U.S. domestic maintenance facilities, and there are costs associated with that., So on the one hand, there are certain efficiencies to be gained by increasing our footprint there. On the other hand, there are very attractively priced facilities elsewhere throughout the country. We're not going to move quickly in this regard. We're going to take our time to study it, look at the available workforce and make sure that as we put any new facilities to work, they'll be margin accretive., I don't know about necessarily full, but they'll be taxed., Thank you., Yes, Tom. It was the highest sales level in our parts businesses in ten years., So not necessarily record, but at least for the last 10 years. In terms of the seasonality, yes, there is some certain seasonality. But historically, the two strongest quarters for our parts businesses have been Q2 and Q4., And so we're fairly pleased with the pace of activity in our parts businesses., We've been very focused on the Middle East market. We've been focused on the Asian market. We've had from success with a recently-opened office in Abu Dhabi. And I would expect that over time, as the world's fleet moves in that direction, that our parts business will follow. So to date, a very large percentage of our parts business is still U.S. centric, also European based, but we do have footprints in Asia and the Middle East. And I would expect that as time moves along, that you'll see increased business coming out from those regions., Absolutely correct, I believe we're not even in the first inning. We've got one man on base and that's about it, and I think there's a lot of runway in front of us., Sure., Eric, it's unfortunately, some – it's arcane GAAP requirements on – now that we've launched our dividend, it flows from the fact that we started paying a dividend. And we have to attribute income to restricted stock shares differently from the shares that are outstanding today. And so if you really want to get into it in a deeper way, I'd suggest maybe offline. But just let's leave it at that. It's a GAAP driven requirement that is all a function of the fact that we launched a dividend and..., That's correct., It will be primarily Oklahoma City with Hot Springs as overflow., Virgin is in Miami., Thanks, Eric., Hi, Larry., Hey, Larry. I think I would characterize the demand as steady. Our engine shops that drive demand for engine parts are busy, our outlook for the MRO business on the commercial side, once we get through this summer, is solid. We're using these summer months to prepare for a busy fall. We're adding capacity in Indianapolis. So, I think I would characterize the demand on the supply chain and the MRO as pretty strong actually., It's a little lumpier, but as you know it's a business that we've been investing in and developing in. We've had some success around, so it will continue to be a little lumpy here, but we do have programs that we're working on, contracts that we've signed with good solid customers that will continue to feed this line., It's new parts distribution, yes., We do, yes we do., Yeah, the operating margins here will be in line with our overall margins., Yeah. So, Larry just to make sure you appreciate that, gross margins may be affected by that, we haven't guided that, but to reiterate what Tim said, I think on an operating margin basis we expect it to be helpful to our goals on the operating margin level for the company., The – our Amsterdam component repair shop that was – we classified as discontinued., Hi, Ken., We're expecting steady growth in that business in this new fiscal year. We did announce the contract win in June which adds a couple of fixed-wing aircraft to our portfolio. We are bidding on the rotary wing contract which will be an extension if you will of some existing aircraft or helicopters that we have in theater and then some additional helicopter lift as well. So we're expecting, for the year, we're expecting steady improvement in operating results for that business., Both on a sales and earnings perspective., Yeah, I would say there's discussions and – progress and discussions. I wouldn't say that we have anything tangible to report at this stage and obviously we will once we do, but I can tell you that the team is being very well received by the customer base – the existing customer base as well as perspective new customers. The business is now headed up by Jeff Schloesser. He has now been with us approximately one year. Jeff is a retired two-star General of the U.S. Army and he commanded the 101st Airborne in Afghanistan for 14 months, so he is highly respected, I should say, inside the company, but also very highly respected inside the government community. So he has built a nice team around him and we are out there talking with folks like the UN, with NATO, with the State Department and other potential users of our services. So, yeah I'd think that we will have some traction in this regard over the next year., Well, we did that, we did experience in our KC-10 program very strong performance, the aircraft are being heavily utilized which drives revenue. In terms of the outlook and the opportunity pool, we are chasing a number of opportunities that are out there, nothing that I can point to that's going to be wrapped up here in the next weeks but there are opportunities that we're pursuing right now., There is a portion of contract that will be with our existing fleet and then there is a portion that will require us to source aircraft from outside. We are in discussions to either acquire some of these assets or lease these assets, so we haven't made determination yet in that regard, but yes, that will require some additional assets., The business we've won to-date, Troy, is reflected in our CapEx guidance, it's possible incremental business that we win could change that but I want to reiterate what David has said, we've had a lot of time to think about financing and we've got several potential lease options as well., In our Government Defense Services segment?, Well, you are up 300 basis points in one quarter right, so I think you need to keep perspective on that. We had a very strong operational improvement and very strong volumes during the quarter as Tim just mentioned. I think we have said for a while we saw opportunity particularly in airlift as we improved our operational capability that would help drive margins so it's – there is certainly a portion of it we expect to be sustainable. I don't expect significant change, Troy, but I think you rounded up to if I am not – I think you said 21 and above, right?, Yeah, so you're kind of going up from where we are and I think you should appreciate what we have achieved so far and I think we will work hard to kind of keep it at these levels., We're not seeing it. The customers we're talking to still have heavy induction schedules, both for engines and aircraft, I mean obviously if it continues for an extended period, it will impact us but our outlook right now is still strong., Yeah., Hi, J. B..., The units in contract, J. B.?, There is some inventory purchase, it's not what we could call massive and we do expect to have some pretty turns on that inventory even in the first year, so it's – maybe at the core of your question, it's not CapEx, it's working capital for us., But it's reflected in David's commentary on expectation of getting back to significant free cash flow generation., That's a four-year, as soon as options are exercised., Thanks, J. B., Hey, Eric, how are you?, Well the composition of the company, let me start with the end your question, I'll try to come back to the beginning of it. I mean the composition of company is a bit different than depending on what historical period you're looking at, Eric. But, the let's just talk since we talked about Airlift on a few of the questions proceeding you, that requires capital upfront but once you spend that capital you have very nice cash profile of that business, as an example. We've grown a lot in our Defense Logistics businesses and those also add very nice cash profiles to those businesses., So the composition of the company with the growth around some of the Government business and even the growth in our MRO business changes what used to be a very working capital hog oriented company of the parts trading. So I think that's my starting commentary. To your question of what's our goal, what do we think is significant I mean our goal would be to create free cash flow somewhere between 80% and 120% of net income., Well, you saw it, certainly this last year, but these unlike I think supply chain trading businesses where you have to constantly reseed new parts to kind of sustain the sales volume, here you buy the airplane once and you get a pretty nice cash flow stream after you've paid for it. So you've seen all the outflow and now we get to reap the rewards of it., Yeah, that's what we are looking at for fiscal '12 Eric. I think I on previous calls have said somewhere in the $60 million zip code is probably right. As you know, the company gets bigger, we will potentially continue to fine tune that number, but yeah that's the way to think about it., I would just say this, we are planning an analyst day, Eric, and we will do that in early October again. We will obviously give more details on that at that time and I think we will have more to say then, but I think you've heard the comments here today about how we feel about the year we just progressed, the momentum we have going into the new year, et cetera. So I think that's the level of guidance we are comfortable with right now., Yeah, we are looking at a few different areas, Eric, and we will stay very disciplined in our approach. Our goals remain consistent in terms of looking for accretion and looking to either build out capability or look for new and interesting markets that fit into our – let's say our capability profile. So, yeah, there is a fair amount of activity in this regard. We in terms of multiples, I think the multiples that we're looking at like I said would be at levels that would accretive to our results., You should expect the more normalized rate Eric, around 35% or so., Eric, the program is definitely stabilized. I think we've seen an improvement as I said earlier in terms of revenue, which obviously helps the bottom line in the yield. I would say that we still have opportunity for improved performance and yield through some efficiencies that we're driving. So, it's – I'd say that we're – maybe our first level of margin performance and we see some opportunities for further improvements., No, a little bit better than that., Sure., Yes, Tyler we do have several of those that come up in fiscal '12. We're working some of that as we speak, in fact, coincidentally we got a deposit today from somebody that may be releasing a few of them or potentially buying a few of them. But there are some that come up much like this year – this time last year we had a much aircraft that will come up in the fiscal '11 and we dealt with them pretty early in the year, that would be our expectation for this year as well., That was a owned roughly 20-year-old A-320 aircraft and with motors that were not very attractive by current standards. So it had some neat characteristics to it. We don't – when we complete these transactions, we will only have three aircrafts in our owned portfolio and one of those is coming off lease just coincidentally later this year and we expect to part it out. So there is – the invested capital on our owned aircraft will be very small after this, Tyler., Yeah, I think our hurdle rate for most of the investments we make in our Commercial businesses would be in that area., We're doing well, we are actually delivering product now on the earliest contract awards and we are in development on a series of new parts, so it's going quite well actually., Yes., Yeah. We – if you look at the business mix there, it's approximately 50/50, it is in that zip code and we're very comfortable with that relationship. I believe that over time, based on demands within those different segments will drive possibly five to seven point variations. But I believe at this stage we are very comfortable with this mix., Yeah., Yeah, I think Ken it's – I think will have some potentially competing forces in terms of the gross margin levels. As we've mentioned earlier, I think you've seen pretty consistent level here for few quarters in a row, but that is consistently below that kind of historical level. So we do believe there is intrinsic upside when you just think about the core business that is there, but working against that a little bit will be what we also talked about a littler earlier is just we onboard our, this larger distribution agreement which will be classified in the segment. Again, that has an operating margin profile that's attractive and will help us achieve some of our operating margin goals, but at a gross margin level, it is likely to be lower. So we need to probably sort that out a little more and get prospectively maybe we'll have a little more to say about that, but I think I just want to appreciate those two things competing against each other., Yeah, I'd say, Ken – I mean, there's structurally nothing different about the business than there was historically. I think we have talked over the last several quarters about a decision on our part to do a little more work on a consignment basis rather than invest capital, take the capital risk and resell it, and we think that's been a smart decision we continue that, that does create a little bit different margin profile but we don't – that's something we are executing in the current environment. I don't think that will necessarily always be the case. So, as we get back to more normal market conditions then I think the old historical opportunities should show themselves again., Well I think – I guess, Ken, I would reiterate some of the things we have said previously, so first and foremost I think it's perspective on how big our operation is relative to the size of the operation that the military is conducting in Afghanistan. We gave you some data earlier about the number of people we carried through 2011. When you compare that to the overall size of what's happening there now, there is a lot of opportunity even if all of the reductions that you've heard about in the press occur. So let's start with that., Then secondly, we've talked for some time about what we believe are opportunities with customers beyond the current customer that we serve as well as geographical reasons beyond the customer we serve and obviously David commented earlier on some of the business development prospects we've had there. So we are – the core of your question kind of was the number one issue we diligenced before we decided to buy this company and we got very comfortable that we believe there's a long-term strong demand for the services we provide., Thanks., Well, Greg, that's a little – I know that sounds like a simple question. But I want to just parse it for you so we make sure we're I answer what you are really talking about. The business that we bought, okay, had a revenue contribution rate of about $45 million a quarter. Okay. And that was something we had almost entirely – we didn't have entirely in the fourth quarter, we had about two thirds of that last year. So you could think about we picked up $15 million this year that you didn't have last year just based on the business we bought and so your growth rate would be still quite high on a year-over-year basis., The business has grown organically under our ownership significantly as well. So what you really asking me is to eliminate the entirety of that business and obviously that would impact the growth year-over-year growth rate a bit more. But you still have a pretty strong government growth rate because I mean our logistics business has grown pretty significantly as well., Yeah, I mean, Greg, we just want some growth business that will go online little later this year where David also talked about bidding on a contract that we expect to hear here where we stand on that in the next 30 to 45 days and that also would represent possibly new additional business coming online. So, yeah, as we say here, we feel pretty good amount of the demand profile for this business., It's totally relative to the airlift, Greg., Probably '07, maybe '06., Yeah, that's a fair statement., The sale of the five assets other than the one that we've made adjustment on there are at a profitable level, there was unusual characteristics around the one and that was on the one aircraft. This was an aircraft that was on lease with a carrier and we had to repossess the asset. We do have a claim against that carrier, unfortunately they're in bankruptcy, we're not certain how we are going to collect on that claim and we factored that in at – we have not factored that into our numbers in any fashion. So that's the unusual characteristics if you will around that aircraft., Yes, Greg, I will start with that. I mean that is still absolutely our goal, still a focus and Unison as said earlier while it may have some impact on reported gross margins, it will assist us in achieving our company operating margin goals. To get there, you did the math, you are right. We made good progress, but we still have ways to go and we have outlined how we get there, continued growth through some of our higher margin areas, continued improvement in some of the execution. There is and we have talked about what those some of opportunities have been, Airlift, KC-10, and some other businesses and then continued leveraging of our cost base. So that's the formula and I think on all fronts we have made progress, but we need to continue to make progress to get to that goal., Yeah, we see actually significant follow-on opportunities. We have some new manufacturing processes associated with this. This was a big win for the company, it's a new shelter platform for us and while the initial award was kind of, I guess you'd say modest in the grand scheme of things, it's a very widely used shelter with lots of different customers that deploy this. So we are really excited about this win., Yeah, it is, yeah. We're in full, we're in production on those units., Right., Yeah, I don't know if it will be quite at $60 million by fiscal '13, Larry, but part of how the math works to get to the total contract value over 10 years is you do have OEM list pricing continuing to rise through that period, so it's not just purely a volume game., But I think your thinking is sound in that. We think volumes will be at a normalized level by fiscal '13 and so we'll ride that through the rest of the contract period., Yeah., We're adding capacity to make the plant as efficient as we can. We have one of the hangers is a widebody hanger with a docking station in it. We're investing capital to remove the docking station so that we can put multiple narrow body aircraft in there so that we can generate more revenue off of that one hanger. That should be online in September at the latest., Indy is pretty full, kind of given the slower summer months so the hours are down a little bit now but we expect to be very busy as we go into the fall., The UPS work is at Indy, and the Virgin work is in Miami., Well, Eric, we're seeing some of each, some of all of those on the commercial side. I'd say that we've got a nice pipeline of supply chain programs that are in various stages of development, so we are encouraged about that pipeline. I think as I said earlier on the Government and Defense side, I think it's maybe a little bit farther out in terms of sizable new programs. But we are working programs as prime and also as sub contractors with some of the large OEMs., Sure, we have three tranches of coverts, as I think you know. The first tranche is with – for $120 million is already in our fully diluted EPS calculation. So that has the lowest convert price that's just under $29.50, that that starts to come into the money but again those shares have been in our fully diluted calculation since we issue those bonds, so you won't have any incremental impact there. The next two tranches have strike prices that are closer to $36, but we did put a bond hedge around both of those as well, so we have actually an effective conversion price that's more or like $, $43., Not until the market responds to these wonderful earnings we had today., Thanks."
1004,2012.0,Q&A,a,"Hi, Larry., Yeah. Yeah, Larry, commercial was up organically. It was up in a similar fashion as the first quarter., So, if you – so we had some aircraft transactions in Q1., Of the – I'm sorry – in Q2 of the prior year. So if you exclude that aircraft transaction, organic commercial growth was 13%., It's – all the decline in government was organic., Yeah. The acquisitions we made last year had no defense component., Yeah, Larry. There was a kind of a modest negative impact in the quarter. We expect just a couple of more months of the kind of investment, if you will. And then by the end of Q3 and going forward, when the second line comes in, we would expect to kind of have all that behind us. So – but it's – the Duluth facility has gone very well. We – the team that we have up there has done a terrific job getting the facility ready. We've had a lot of support from the community and from the regulators. So it's really on track to do everything we thought it was going to do., Hi, Julie., Hi, Julie., Well the decline is primarily due to two areas; one, the decline at mobility systems, where we've finished off a significant contract and the contract wasn't renewed. And then also, on some of our supply chain programs, one of which is still in existence but operating at a lower level. And then the second one has been discontinued. So those were the two contributors to the decline., In terms of where we go from here, I think we're going to be in this same kind of general area as we go forward, with the possibility of modest growth. And then we have some special situations, which are going to move the numbers around, like the aircraft transaction that David mentioned., Yeah. I think we're going to be – like I said, I think we're going to be at these levels going forward, out into the next few quarters again, well, with the exception of that aircraft transaction. So I think the easiest way to look at it is flat going forward., So, Julie, the mobility business, we do not expect any further decline to the mobility business in Q3 and Q4., Well I think what we're saying is that organically, our organic growth in the commercial aviation pieces of our business were in the 13% range., And that would include MRO and supply chain., Yeah., Well we're looking at that business in a few different ways. I mean clearly, right now, we have a high degree of concentration in the Afghanistan theatre. We have had a little indication from the customer of a reduction in demand. However, we are anticipating that as we get towards the end of the – a sequence of business, that there will be a reduction in demand. Although we're not seeing that and we've not been told that, we're kind of thinking that's the case., We have a plan then to go ahead and adjust the fleet, if necessary, and solicit other customers for this type of service. And as I said in the past, there's other DoD type opportunity, the State Department opportunity, the UN opportunities. And there are numerous opportunities around the world that the team is looking at. So when you look at the progression of the business, you recall last year, we were having a hard time keeping aircraft up in the sky. This year, we're doing a really good job of executing on the business. Customer has taken note of our performance, and we continue to believe that the revenue opportunity and margin opportunity for the business continues to be there., I think it's reasonable that we get some additional business away from the current theatres in the next six months., Well we don't believe there's much downside from here. I mean the business dropped significantly from its peak. But I think we've indicated here that the revenues on a year-over-year basis are down $36 million or $35 million – $33 million from a sequential basis. Tim indicated that we worked our way through a few contracts. So I don't think you see much more decline at this stage., Keep in mind, there's three pieces to this – there're four pieces to this business. There's the manufacture of the 463L Pallet where we're the exclusive provider to U.S. Air Force. They have the, container business. And just give you sense, we booked some orders for the activity in Turkey. And then you have your shelter business, which is more of a larger cycle – a longer-cycle business that relate to the replacement of the shelters, typically in a 20-year cycle. And this on a regular flow of activity that supports that replenishment/replacement cycle for the shelters., And the fourth piece is the service business where we repair the pallets, containers and the shelters. And we see no reason to think that, that business will decline at all. So we – clearly, we signaled at the time, we had – we were a beneficiary of various surges that were taking place around the world. And I think we performed very well through that period. And now we're getting down to, say, a more normalized, peaceful environment level of activity., Yeah. Service business done fairly well during this period. You have the return of the equipment; it needs to be put back into serviceable conditions. And so typically, we've done fairly well in that regard, yes., We expect to have four lines of work in Duluth. And it's – that's pretty much the max. So you can still – you can do some work out on the ramp and things like that, but it's basically four lines max., Yeah. So what – percentage wise, what..., So on a year-over-year basis, the sales increase at airlift was up about 30%., No. I mean I wouldn't say, J. B., there was any one-timers in there. We did adjust some of the infrastructure in Q1, as we talked about in December. So more that benefit fell through in Q2. Q1 has the tendency to be a little higher with some of the year-end expenses and so on and so forth. But there was really no unusual items in the Q2 number., Yeah., Thanks., Hey, Jon., Yes, it is., And it's not a segment, just to clarify. That's a business..., Okay. Okay., Yes, it is., It's still a terrific business, Jon. It's just operating at significantly lower volumes., We're always looking at those kinds of things. The team has done, I think, a good job sizing the cost structure of the business so it reflects kind of the new reality. It's the kind of business that we have to make sure that we maintain our flexibility because we can get a phone call any moment, actually, and be asked to produce significant quantities of pallets, shelters and containers relatively quickly. So we don't want to skinny it back too much. But I would say that they've done a good job making sure that the cost structure is sized properly., Yeah. We have it in our presentation that we just made in Florida. Do you have that?, Jon, I don't have that with me, but I can give you a call., Call back., Should be on our website right?, On our website., Yeah. So there's $42 million left on the buyback. The priorities would be to fund our growth and the business, to continue to pay down debt and then to acquire shares., Well, directionally, we're looking to continue to improve the margin, , Yes. So first of all, to answer your question, what do I see? I really like our position in the commercial markets. If you look at our Aviation Service sector, I like the opportunities that we're looking at and the position that the company has relative to those opportunities. I also believe that the service offerings that we have for the U.S. DoD as well as other DoDs will be a positive for the company., The Telair acquisition, as you can see, has been a nice addition to our family. And actually, the COO of that business unit happens to be in the room here right now. He's done a fine job prior to AAR's ownership as well as continuing through AAR's ownership of making that a nice contributor to our company. There will be meetings next month with our existing or legacy cargo business to look for ways that we can look for synergies, both from the cost side as well as from the market development side. So, yeah, I view that acquisition in a very positive light. I think the – you're seeing some of the contributions that they've made to the company's consolidated results in a positive light. And I see that continuing., Well I don't have a view – I don't know to handicap that from happening, , I think as the – as American moves from its current mode into its next mode, I think the company will be well positioned to support that entity. But I won't tell you that we have any dialogue of any nature of any significance going on with them at this movement., U.S. Air is a good customer of the company's, and we touch them in numerous places. So we'll see what happens., I agree., Okay. Thanks., Hi, Dan., Yeah. Dan, last year included – both in the third and fourth quarter – a couple of adjustments. We're not anticipating that type of adjustment to occur right now in Q3 or Q4. So we would expect the tax rate for the back half of the year to be right in that 34.5% to 35% range., So, yeah, back at the end of November, we announced that we had reached agreement to sell 10 737-400s to the lessee. Those aircraft were acquired by AAR and our joint venture partner back in 2007 – or I believe it's 2007. And those joint ventures are non-consolidated joint ventures. So they're owned by the joint venture. So when the joint venture sells the aircraft, the sale does not go though our top line. The gain on the transaction will go through the line on the P&L that addresses earnings and aircraft joint ventures. The income from the existing leases has been minimal to zero. Yeah., Think of that transaction as a cash generator. So we reduce our obligations and the venture that was supporting the assets. And then we recapture our cash basically that we have invested., We were right around $8 million for Q2, Dan. And I would expect that Q3 and Q4 is going to be a similar dollar amount, right in that roughly $8 million range., Hold on a second., $10 million., $10 million., More than., $11 million., Thank you., It's continuing to ramp. It's ramping very, very well. And we're still – we still believe we're going to achieve our target., Larry, yeah, we've talked a little bit about Precision Systems the last few quarters, and we continue to see steady improvement in that business. There was a nice improvement in Q2, and we expect that to continue in the back half of fiscal 2013., Yeah – no, I mean that's from the existing leases. There's actually been as many of these aircraft are nearing the end of the lease, there's some – I guess lack of a better way to put it – some settling , And it's generally been favorable for us the last couple quarters., And there might be a little bit more that moves into Q3., But that basically is what accounts for what you're seeing., Yes., Well we never actually closed it. We..., Yeah. We attempted to sell., We weren't happy with the possibilities there. We kept the business open. The business actually has had a nice resurgence. So we're fairly – feeling pretty good – much better about that business today than we felt, say, two years ago., That's correct., Yeah., Hi, Tom., Hi, Tom., Yeah – no, I think that there's some of that in there, Tom. But basically, you've had decisions by Delta; you've had decisions by Southwest; you've had decisions by other carriers that may not be necessarily tied to the 787. But I do believe that as the 787 does stabilize in its delivery that you will see more aircraft movement., Yeah. So I think what we've said is that we have been consciously reducing the size of our portfolio because we are too small of a niche player. We are, however, at the same time – we've been in the business of trading and creating value around the aircraft for decades now. And that activity will continue. And I think the trade we had during the quarter where the actual aircraft will be delivered second half of the year is indicative of the kind of capability that we have as a company. So it's very hard for us to be in front of our customers with the kind of business we have and not be in a position to discuss all aircraft transactions at the same time. We just don't think that we have a – an opportunity in the leasing end of the business., Yeah. I would say that continues to be a problem. We have worked very closely with the state and the local authorities up in Duluth to reopen the facility. The facility sat vacant for five years, and was built by Northwest in the middle of the 1990s. It's a very modern type of facility. There is a supply of mechanics that remain in the military, and there are many mechanics that migrated away from Duluth when the facility closed who are eager to get back in town., We expect a steady ramp in labor. We've had a good – we've been able to pull people from some of our other MROs to fill some of the voids. And we have a robust search and training and hiring process that we expect to continue., We're creating – within the company, we've created the one MRO strategy where we're creating a similar look and feel across our network. And I think it's very exciting for mechanics to know that they have the flexibility to join us in any number of locations., Yep. Thank you., Yeah. That's Duluth., Well the contract that discontinued was our JSTARS contract. And that ended, as you recall, last October., So we had some impact in last year's numbers that we weren't able to replace this year. And then you had a reduction in the volumes around the KP10 program., Well we're expecting to sell – complete the sale of two aircraft in this quarter. And then we're hopeful that we can – that'll bring us down where we'll have two 737s remaining from the MAS fleet. We would hope that we find places for those aircraft over the next year, keeping in mind our investment is fairly minimal once we get to that point. And then we have a couple of 767s on lease with United which, right now, are doing well. And we see no reason to sell them, other than if somebody comes long and offers us a price..., 737s., Not as good a cash flow generator because we get paid over time. But it will be – in time, it'll be good cash flow generator. Yeah., Yeah. Yeah..., Hi, Larry., Hi., Yeah, Larry. So, I think the best way to think about our government defense stool, if you will, is with three separate legs. One being Airlift, two being our defense logistics businesses and three being our mobility products and other manufacturing businesses. Our Airlift business, I think we've talked about quite a bit, we expect to have solid demand in that business for the foreseeable future and we expect increased and improved financial results from that business as a result of a lot of the operating improvements that we've talked about both on this call and previous calls., Our defense logistics business is the business where our KC10 among other programs is and that program, as you know, we obviously lowered our margin expectations. That margin expectation goes forward with us going forward, but I think with that adjustment, demand remains pretty good for that business as we look ahead. So as we think about Q4 as the baseline for that business, we'll obviously be impacted by operating tempo of business, but otherwise we think the assets that we support are very important assets for our customer and should continue to operate not withstanding what's happening with defense spending right now., And then the third leg of the store, our mobility products and other manufacturing, I think that's the business that has performed well through fiscal 2012, but we do see some lower backlog, and we'd expect that to be down as we look ahead., So that total perspective I just shared is embedded in the guidance that we've given so far., Well, our mobility products in specific, Larry, we think are strategically still critical to our customer., So it's not a question if they become obsolete or anything like that., There've always been some ebbs and flows in demand..., For the products, and certainly the amount of spending and funding available will help – will drive some of those ebbs and flows, but we – again, we feel good fundamentally about that business for the long term, but we do expect a little slowing of demand in the near term., Larry, Unison is a part of it, but I would say, on balance, we're seeing new programs coming on board. You'll see a lot of interest in AAR as a distributor, both on commercial and military product line. So, we're encouraged by our overall performance there, with Unison being a part of it., Our backlog, or our contracts, are good through fiscal 2013, actually through part of fiscal 2014. So we feel good about the visibility there. We were encouraged by the improvement in performance that we've seen over the last several months. As David said in his comments, we expect this performance to continue., In terms of new opportunities that are out there, we see a variety of different avenues that we're pursuing. Much of our attention of late has been on improvement and execution, but at the same time, we are now out there in the market – in the markets – looking for ways to diversify our offerings and get into markets that we see providing us opportunity out into the next several years., Well, there's a lot of money being spent in the areas that we're talking about. In some cases, the money is going to operators that are non-U.S. based. We think that those are ripe opportunities for us to go after and capture. So, I would say that the opportunity pool, or at least the – opportunity pool, we'd say, is extensive., There's still opportunity for better operational performance, which translates to better financial performance. So we see additional upside as the year progresses. In terms of meeting customer expectations, we're significantly improved. So now it's about operational improvement, managing our planning and our cost, our inventory levels, and then translating that into improved financial performance., I would say that we've experienced a significant improvement, but we're not giving up, and we see additional opportunities for improvement., Yeah, Tyler, we continue to prune the portfolio. As you know, we've been working that for quite a while now. And we would expect to have further JV items that get cleared up this year. Having said that, I think the emphasis will be on generating cash. I wouldn't expect a big P&L impact from those transactions, but you should expect to hear – see more of the portfolio being addressed throughout fiscal 2013., Well, you'll note from my CapEx comment, Tyler, that capital spending will be down significantly., And I would just , Thanks, J.B., 
            , Yes and no. I think there's – a little bit yes and a little bit no. I can't say it's fully reflected in the numbers., Yeah., Right., That's correct., I prefer not to go there, I prefer to go ahead and see our – watch our performance. Maybe we can put more visibility to that as we put Q1 to bed in September and go from there, , Well, do I see it in the possibility of the future of the business? Absolutely. So, I believe that, at this point in time, we have execution issues that we've addressed. We've been all over these execution issues. As we know, these margins will improve and I prefer, at this stage at least, we do have internal goals, so I prefer at this stage to go ahead and – as I've indicated, , Yeah, yes, , May be even a little higher., Yes., Thank you., Right. So, just to – so we're clear. When you think of our logistics business, you have to think of two businesses, our commercial logistics business and our defense logistics business., Our commercial logistics business has been very strong, and you see growth rates far in excess of the industry or any other measurement. So, let's make sure we're clear in that regard. As it relates to our defense logistics business, we've had less utilization by the customer. We've had a couple of programs go away, one program in particular. And we had a charge-off in terms of our expectation around the KC10 profitability on the flight hour agreement aspect of that program., We do believe that the defense market is ripe with opportunities. Our organization is all over those opportunities, and we would anticipate over time that that business will be performing very well as well. So, when you think of AAR's logistics businesses, I would say on balance, they're very strong., Yeah., Absolutely and we'll continue to do that as well. So, we're hoping generating enough cash to do both. So, if you look at the prior periods, we've taken our excess cash and we've bought down our convertible debt and we've done that quite successfully , Tyler, it's Tim. It's a – the Spirit is one area where we are not delivering as much as we had anticipated. We have a couple of other programs that we are working through both on the cost and pricing side as well as delivery performance. So, there is a few programs in addition to Spirit that we are working to improve. We have made some progress. We are working hard on the C-series. We see some light there, but it's not just Spirit, but Spirit is one of the programs that we are working to improve., I think we see progress here. We do expect that it is going to take a little bit of time to fully implement the actions that we are taking. But we have confidence that we'll see improvement as we go into the new fiscal year., Tyler, I would add too. Part of our challenge is, I think we expanded capacity pretty aggressively. We have some inefficient capacity utilization right now and I think we have seen opportunity to correct some of that as well., Yeah. There were no – so let's start by saying there were no transactions during the quarter, so none of the results were impacted by that. We continue to work the portfolio. You should expect to hear more from us as those deals come to fruition. We have some LOIs right now that we're continuing to work towards binding agreements. But there is really no story during the quarter on aircraft right now., Hi, Larry., The – Larry, it's Tim again. The aircraft, while they're in-theater, they're not on the certificate yet., We are optimistic that we're going to get them on the certificate in the next week to 10 days, but we're managing it closely, but they're not on certificate now. So, I don't want you to think that they aren't., In terms of the maintenance issues, there – we have an unacceptable number of aircraft that are out of service. Our teams both , It has, I has, some of it is maintenance-related specific kind of failures of the aircraft and others of it is extra inspections that we've taken on as a result of the situation that we had in January, so, but you're right, it has., This is – Larry, this is still very profitable., And it's still exceeding what we started out with, but it's just not hitting the targets that we know are achievable or nor that we're hitting the path as well., That's correct., That's right. And Larry, one point of clarity too, I think you mentioned S-92s. The S-92s are in service and are performing extremely well., The aircraft – yeah, the aircraft that were – have been slow to get in are actually S-61s, which is a smaller helicopter., The aircraft came in, in lousy conditions and our people through the – the acceptance inspection, rejected the aircraft. The aircraft then needed a change out some major components. We then were a little slow in going through the certification process with the FAA., We ultimately made the delivery date and shipped the aircraft into theater, but without having the aircraft on the certificate with the goal of having the aircraft on the certificate, shortly after arrival in Afghanistan. The aircraft are there now ready to be operated, however they are not on our certificate yet. And we've heard anywhere from one day to 10 days, but hopefully we get them on the certificate here very quickly. The aircraft will be in good serviceable condition and will be ready to operate at the day we get the certification clear., Yeah, this deal is around the Airbus Military fleet of CASA aircraft, which is their backbone to the military fleet and the – our Amsterdam shop is configured to go ahead and handle parts similar to the parts that would be coming off of this – of these type of aircraft. We believe and we've been led to believe that if successful in supporting Airbus on this program that there'll be further programs with Airbus. The jewel in the Airbus Military fleet would be the A400M, once that aircraft gets into production., Yeah., Hi Ken., Well. I mean, Ken – bare with – appreciate we don't usually talk about specific contributions at a business level. I think suffice it to say though, you can look at the segment results year-over-year and you'd see that a pretty good chunk of a fall-off year-over-year is attributable to airlift, okay. That's the GDS segment, sorry, Government and Defense Services segment., So that will give you some sense – to the second part of your question. I think the $0.10 is meant to give you a sense of – we believe the rehabilitation of both of these kind of deficiencies is within our control and it gives you a sense for what the magnitude is. And in terms of the relative split, you could think of them as pretty close to equal opportunities., So slightly, more on the airlift side., Yeah, I mean, I'd reiterate what we've said to one of the questions too as well, Ken, I mean fundamentally, the business has had – it had a little bit of executional challenges with some startup programs, but we also, I think are suffering from some inefficient capacity utilization right now. And I'm not sure if restructuring is the right word, but you should look for us to continue to execute profit improvement initiatives that could include some footprint rationalization as well., Yeah., So, when we look at the capacity issue that you've clearly articulated, we view that as a real positive for the company. We believe that there will be ample capacity taken out of the industry. There is a little bit of a flipside to that and that is that you may have some airlines pairing some capacity, if fuel prices continue to be as high as they have been. But I think net-net, when you look at the pros and you look at the positives and negatives, I believe net-net, it should improve the pricing environment for us and we are seeing some of that., So, if you look at our engineering – I'm sorry, if you look at our MRO segment and if you were to take the engineering piece out, if you look at purely our heavy maintenance piece of the business, you will see margin improvement. And as we come into this quarter, we're expecting not only a contribution from the engineering segment – piece of that business, but we're also expecting the margins in MRO to strengthen as well., Yeah, the outlook is good actually, we'll start delivering on existing contracts in the fourth quarter here and will continue through next fiscal year, and then we'll be looking to add some business behind that. So the outlook is good here., Thanks, Ken., Good morning., Hi, J. B., Yeah, well, I mean, J. B. I guess, here would be my response to that, so what I said was I made a comment with regard to our Unison distribution agreement, which as you know, is scaling up and so, in the grand scheme of full results for the segment, is a small contributor, but the trend there is nevertheless very positive for us. We exited the quarter with the strongest month yet under that agreement. So we're very encouraged by that., Our trading businesses – engine and airframe trading businesses, which would be more larger contributors to the overall segment results, tend to skew later in the quarter anyway, so it's not – it may not be as pure of a read as you would like, but we had extremely strong February in both of those businesses., There is no one-time deal related cost J. B., but you do pickup some amortization from purchase accounting, so that's with us to stay for a little while. I think we've for a long time targeted getting our number below 10%. We had a couple of pretty good quarters there where it was closer to 9%, but I think kind of mid-9% is where we're targeting right now., Hi, Eric., Hi, Eric., Yeah. I just – there's just – we had some write-offs that we had to take during the quarter and it's just a couple of – well, again, what I'll just call one-time charges. Eric, nothing – there's not really a bigger story to it than that. What the real point I wanted to leave you with is, I don't expect to experience them in the fourth quarter, and if you correct it for those in the quarter, you'd see – you'd definitely see a couple of hundred basis point lift, and so between that and we had a tough comp with engineering services, so that will change as well. So, we're feeling pretty good. Even absent any improvement to the pricing environment, we're feeling pretty good about a lift in margins there, and if we get some lift on pricing as well, that could even look better., I would orient you back to 11.8% is clearly disappointing to us. I would orient you towards what you saw more in the first two quarters, and then hopefully..., Okay, so last quarter., Yeah. Let's say, look – we've always, this is a segment that has always bounced by our target between kind of 14% to mid-15%, as high as 16% and what I'm saying to you is, we should be comfortably within that range with hopefully upside potential., Yeah, I don't think I'd really have any figures for you there. We'll have to probably think about that, Eric, and get back to you guys. I mean the fleet – the operating fleet as you know approximates roughly 50 fixed and rotary-wing aircraft. We've tried to build up a spare complement around that operating fleet to try to booster or bolster I should say aircraft availability, the unplanned maintenance events, while you tend to occupy those spares and then some and that's what suffering so far. So that leaves us in a position where we're not able to deliver the ready aircraft that our customers are looking for., In terms of giving you more numbers or guidance on that, I think we'll have to think about that, back to you., So, Eric, on the specific situation you're asking about, they are a – we're doing a fair amount of work for them. We don't have a significant exposure. So, we've taken care of that part of the risk. We do expect that requirement that – utilization of that fleet to continue no matter what actually happens with Pinnacle. But, I think as David mentioned we're seeing other opportunities out there, including American as you mentioned, but we see robust demand for MRO services across – really across the market. So, we're watching it very closely. We keep very close tabs on the – on customer performance. We do have a, though, a blue-chip list of customers in our MRO business. So, we feel good about our position there and we feel good about the opportunities for additional work., October, right., Yeah, we bought Airinmar in October, just to clarify. Airinmar's sales – remember, Airinmar is primarily about obtaining a capability that we think we can both leverage across our existing businesses that we own and then market it on a third-party basis to airlines, et cetera. The answer to your question is they had low single-digit million-dollar sale contribution., Thank you., So, first of all, if we look at the entire – across the spectrum of AAR activities, I believe that there are positives and negatives. So, I do believe that there will be a series of positives related to the ways that we can help the Defense Department reduce its expenses. They have been in contact with the company to ask us to share best practices around commercial – our experience in the commercial world, recognizing that we've been faced with customers who have been financially challenged for decades. They see some of our skill-sets as being able to assist them in achieving their missions, while doing it within a compressed budget environment. At the same time, we of course are a manufacturer of certain products for the DoD, which we have some concern around, how those get impacted by budget actions, and so we'd be probably looking at the Structures and Systems group a little differently than we'd be looking at the, say, MRO and Supply Chain and Government Services segments of our business. So, we – the comments are around going ahead and making certain that we get ahead of the trend and not get behind it and – so, therefore, do the best we can. And, Rick alluded to looking at – taking a look at our – the capacity and ways to go ahead and streamline capacity. So, hopefully that's helpful., In the – yeah, the mobility group would be the group that would be largely focused around – 100% of our business is of a government orientation. So, yeah, they would be the most dramatically impacted by budget cuts., Yeah, that piece of our segment?, The – it's a meaningful piece of the business. I don't – we prefer not to disclose that for competitive purposes but that being said, it's a important part of our Structures and Systems segment., No. That business will remain very profitable and it will be a very healthy business. They will continue to – their backlog is still fairly – is pretty strong. They – current inputs are strong. Well, I'm just giving you my view in terms of what may happen with defense budgets. I view it as a potential neutral for the corporation, but I think it could be a negative for our Systems – Structures and Systems group., Well, I can't really – I don't think I really have a crystal ball in that regard. There is a lot of moving parts around the defense budget. Keep in mind that the services that we offer are fairly critical to the operation of the Defense Department. So, as I've indicated, they – this is not a falling-off-the-cliff situation. I think that what I'm alerting you to is the fact that the defense budget cuts are real and I believe will impact our Structures and Systems group. I do believe, though, at the same time that we will see certain benefits as a result of dialogue we've had with the Defense Department that we will see benefits elsewhere in the company as they look to go ahead and streamline their operation., They got a major hurdle in terms of – they're faced with the following scenario. The world is about as unsettled as it's ever been. The equipment that they operate is of a aging nature and, yes, their budget is coming under immense pressure. So, they must be in a position to deliver against multiple fronts, though. And, they have to have their equipment up and running and they have to do that while they are operating under a reduced budget environment. So, very similar how the airlines have operated for the last 30 years and we have a lot of experience in helping the airline community in navigating through tough times and the DoD recognized that we have that skill-set that can be helpful to them as well., Yes., Good morning., So, the existing facilities are very busy. The – there is additional upside on yield, we believe, through process improvement and other initiatives. In terms of capacity, there are other facilities that we can move into fairly rapidly and we're positioned to do that. So, we can grow this business beyond our existing footprint in relatively quick fashion. And so, as we see some of the opportunities that are emerging and we're talking to our customers about some of this incremental capacity that's available to us. So, to summarize, we're pretty well booked up at our existing facilities, but we have other alternatives to talk to customers about once they're ready to move., No, it would be very flexible for us. So, we could have it for a long time or if it – if there was a peak, we'd be able to size it to the – to whatever the requirement is., It's modest, yes., Well, I think to your point, it's hard to say precisely only because like – to your point, we've only owned the business for two years. But, I think if you look at the airline business in general I think there are peaks and valleys in the maintenance cycles of the aircraft. We happened to hit a high peak here in terms of the maintenance requirement for the fleet. We also, though, have had a fair amount of unscheduled maintenance which I would venture to say is unusual; however, could it happen again? The answer would probably be yes., Yes., Yes, you pull into a station and a radio is out or you do your – a line station inspection, you find a crack so there is any variety of reasons., The one thing I would like to make sure though that is captured here is the business is still highly profitable and still ahead of our expectations when we made the acquisition. So, just keep things in perspective. We set a high target in terms of what our expectations were. We did achieve some of those targets in prior periods like last year this time of year. But, we had had some things not go our way, let's say, and hopefully, we can get back to where we had been in terms of performance on this business., Yes., Yes., Yeah. So, the demand remains very strong. But, we're also receiving demand from other sources outside of that market and we're trying to figure out how to go ahead and either reposition assets out of that market, into new markets or go ahead and augment our position with newer assets. So, this is ongoing opportunity/challenge for us that we continue to work. But, the short-term needs inside of that market remain very robust and very strong. And, we see no signs of any fall-off in demand for our products and services. As a matter of fact, we're anticipating as there is a little bit of draw-down that the organic equipment will leave first and the demands for our product will be as strong as we've experienced here in the two years that we've owned the business., Yeah, I mean that's how we funded it. That's correct. We had – so recognize we – the acquisitions that we closed in the first week of December had a price tag of $280 million. And so we had prepared ourselves to fund that by upsizing our revolving credit facility and then we followed on with the bond offering in January to reload some of that credit facility. But that's your big driver to the debt increase., You're welcome., Yeah, , That is correct., Well I think what we're seeing , Yes. I think the first use of cash will be to paydown debt., As we generate more cash, we'll take a look. But I think right now, if you're asking me near-term, I would say that as we generate cash, we will be paying down our debt., Well, so there's two ways that we can assist the Defense Department, two or three ways that we can assist the Defense Department, one is around MRO, one is around logistics spare parts, and logistics, and – availing them of some of our IT capability. And then we also have our – the airlift operation, which has proven to the Defense Department that we can lower their operating expenses. If I had to zero-in on the areas of most impact, I would start with supply chain, I would then go to MRO, I would then go to that – the third piece. So I think the greatest ability for us to impact DoD budgets or the quickest way would be through the supply chain where we have – where the location is not critical., Right., Thank you., Yeah, I think you have both. So I can't quite – I won't be in a position right now to quantify that. We can – we probably could be in a position to quantify that, I don't know if we are on this call. But I would say you probably have a little bit of both. You clearly have environmental challenges, which is why the margin is as strong as it is. And at the same token, we have imposed certain maintenance requirements that would be self directed. So probably a little bit of each and if you want to get more granular, we can get back to Rick and we can provide that in short order., Yeah. We prefer not – we don't get into that specifically, but suffice to say that if the category, the S-61 category, is a very profitable aircraft for the company., Yeah. But, Andrew, recognize, those two aircraft are part of a – they are part of a broader puzzle. We have a few other aircraft that we think will back in the service that have been out on inspections and we have longer list of pipeline of spare aircraft as well. So the ultimate resolution of airlift's portion of our – what I quantified as a $0.10 per share shortfall is addressed by all of those events, not just the two., I think in this case you have a combination of issues. We kind of have a – I'd prefer not to get too deep into some of these issues only because they do have competitive implications, but we do have a series of initiatives going on to address all these efficiencies, it addresses the types of products that we're producing. So there is a series of types, if you will, that are being addressed and our team is pretty much all over this at this stage., The Airbus Military contract that we've talked about on the call and then announced last week is – will be worth, it's approximately $5 million a year to start and as you've heard a couple of occasions we think that's a platform for – potentially more from them., We had available liquidity of north of $300 million., On the mix, we have strong aftermarket coming out of Telair, which is kind of one of the motivations in buying – in acquiring the business, so I – we were pleased with the progress there. We are working on a fairly large program in that business that would be a pleasant surprise and something that we had not previously anticipated. The Nordisk business is pretty much as we had expected. It's kind of a – it's a business kind of a grind them out kind of business, and I don't think we're going to see much excitement or unexpected positives or negatives coming from that business. So the focus inside our company is largely around the Telair opportunity and that's the one that we zeroed-in on when we made these acquisitions and that one is far more positive than we had anticipated., Yeah. So, it's – let me first start by – Eric, it's not as harsh as 0%. We are able to book some margin but it's not what a full spares margin might look like. So you are correct in that, there is a little bit of dilution relative to what a full run rate of spare would look like but not zero. And then the answer to your question is we think we'll have it still in Q4 but then once we get by Q4, it should probably have burned through the most of the inventory., Yeah, I think we've just – we've trying to give you some color on how we feel about the fourth quarter, some of the good things and the bad. And with that, we will let you guys do your own updates; we're not going to formally update the ranges we had out there., In Q4?, That's our expectation. Yes., Okay. Thanks, Eric., We had a broad – obviously a broader range, Tyler, on the sales side. You can see, the sales we had for Q1 are certainly on a linear basis, are within the guidance we had out there, so we haven't really decided to make any update to that. If we feel it's appropriate to do so, we'll do that prospectively, but we're sticking with what we have out there., Hey, Tyler. No. We're excited about the prospects for Duluth. We think we can add some place between 350,000 and 450,000 manhours a year. So it just depends on the mix of work that we – that comes through the facility. We are expecting it to be a lower cost facility, so we're optimistic about our opportunity for margin and delivering real value to the customers., The value proposition for our MRO business is very strong. Customers like the breadth of the offerings that we have for them, the flexibility, the ability to go to a variety of different locations, the benefits of having our engineering capability, as well as our parts support. So it was a – when the opportunity came to us, it was a natural and we're excited to be in that facility., Tyler, I would just add, just for context, what Tim mentioned, that manhour opportunity is about a 10% delta to what we have, what we performed last year., Yeah. That was a option exercise that our customer, current customer did. It's activity we've done for years, Tyler. The dollar amount is a ceiling that allows the customer to go that high, we don't expect volumes to be that high. The volumes we do expect under that contract are embedded in our plan and the guidance we've already provided., Yeah. I think mix is the operative word, Larry, both distribution as well as some of our program business that we do. We're very happy about that at an operating profit margin line, but on a gross margin line, doesn't compare as favorably as some of the parts transaction business., Yeah. I guess I'd go to my comment, I'd like to start with my comment that we made. Increasingly, all of our businesses are going to market much more..., Integrated, Larry. And so what gets reported in one segment is not necessarily indicative of what a program value may be, because it may drive a lot of activity in other segments as well. So I think that's a large driver for why we're going to portray the company in a little different manner as we go forward. But yeah, suffice it to say, we like program activity, it's stickier business and we think it gives us an opportunity to touch a lot of our various business units., Correct., I think we'll be responsive to what investors need to make informed decisions and we'll certainly talk about everything, anything that makes sense to talk about as a driver of the business., On a sequential basis? No. We did take out, we bought back some of our bonds., And that creates a little bit of a positive arbitrage for us, so..., So I can't think of anything else off the top of my head, Larry, that explains that., We're continuing to see improvement in our precision systems business and – but we're not where we need to be yet. So I guess the short answer is, yeah, we see opportunity for improved results coming from – coming out of that business., And airlift obviously has come back strong, although we do still see opportunities for improved results there., Good morning, Jon., Good morning, Jon., I think if you look at the existing fleet profile and the existing business mix, you have some room for improvement. I would say, it's at this level more modest than dramatic. I do believe though, you will continue to see modest improvement. We have the demand – the incoming demand for the service is fairly strong. We have to weigh what we – how we manage the fleet against these opportunities. Most of these opportunities would be non-DoD related, which is something we're interested in as it relates to diversifying the mix inside that business., So I would be cautiously optimistic, that there are good growth opportunities for that business. I am pleased – and I just was at the business on Monday, visiting with the leadership team and discussing the future of the business. And what we really determined, Jon, was that we wanted to give the business, starting back on June 1, we wanted to focus the next six months on meeting our commitments and supporting the existing customer, doing a better job of capturing the available revenue that we have and that we would then sit down at the end of November, after a six-month period and look at the investment opportunities, the business opportunity, the investment that goes with that opportunity and then, make some determinations., But I would anticipate that through the balance of this fiscal year, you will continue to see steady improvement. The results will be – will continue to be solid and I think at some point in time within the fiscal year, we'll probably make some determinations as to how we grow from here., Keep in mind, when we acquired the business, the revenues were approximately $175 million and this year, we'll be looking at somewhere between, let's call it, $300 million and $340 million. So we've had some pretty meaningful growth in this 2.5 year period. And we've stubbed our toe a little bit in the middle of – at the end of last fiscal year, so we want to make sure we're on solid footing as we look at any dramatic expansion opportunities., Yeah. We have a lot of flexibility on our lease in terms of synchronizing our payments with the level of activity. And we also got – had a good working relationship with the city and the state, that made it attractive for us to come in there. They helped us with some of the startup training, they helped us get the facility configured. So the impact on margins in the grand scheme of things is minimal, as we start up., Nothing that's obvious at this moment. I think, if you look at – if it passes prologue to the future, then there would be an indication at least, that there'll be more opportunities going forward than there have been in the past. So I would say, stay tuned., Hi, J. B., Morning., Let me take a crack at sequestration. It is in our mind. So it is factored into our view of this – the balance of this fiscal year. It's a very hard matter for us to handicap. The activities we have that support live action if you will, we don't see the impact in any fashion., In terms of some of the longer-term programs and I think one of the reasons why we've dialed it back on the mobility business, is because of concerns around sequestration. I think it's really – it's a very troublesome concept and yet, I don't think as we sit here today, I or too many other companies like us, really have a lot of visibility. So there's no dialogue per se with us and the customer talking about any pullbacks or anything of that nature., We do not – unlike others, who feel compelled to issue warn notices, we are not looking at issuing warn notices, at least as we sit here today. That's obviously subject to change in the event that we are notified or get some indication that some of our programs are under severe pressure. So that has not been the case yet, but it is in our minds, it is factored into our view on the fiscal – the balance of the fiscal year. And there is a degree of uncertainty surrounding that issue., No. We haven't seen any impact there. We actually haven't seen any impact in our business. If you take a look at our defense results in the first quarter, they're up 1%. What we are expecting as we've indicated, based on our backlogs, we are expecting our mobility business to soften throughout the balance of the fiscal year., Yes. There's 10 days left in the month, obviously, J. B., but nothing unusual is happening now in terms of a big push at the end of the year here., Thank you."
1004,2013.0,Q&A,a,"Yeah. I'd say that we're making progress. All of our assets right now are fully-employed. So we're working on a strategy to have assets that can be utilized elsewhere. But yes, suffice to say that we have some interesting paths that we're exploring at this point., Well, I think we're expecting the level of activity that we're currently experiencing to continue for a period of time. So the customer is indicating to us, at least, that they don't see a softening of demand for – through next year. So at this stage, we see that – the pace continuing. Just to give you a sense, the number of flights and the number of hours that we're logging this December versus last December, where there's approximately 30,000 less troops, are very similar to each other, a matter of fact, slightly higher this year than prior years. So even with reduction in force, it feels like that the demand is not tailing off. So I think you've heard me say this before, we don't – we handle approximately 1,000 passengers a day. So you still have 66,000 American troops, I believe, in , Well, I don't know about rebid. But we have a bid that comes due – we have an option that comes due in May. It's a fixed swing option. We've been verbally told, as we have in the past, that that will be exercised. And then we have a couple meaningful options that come due in October and November, later in this calendar year., We have that one aircraft sale that we've – I've talked about in my comments, the Colombian Air Force, which we will be delivering in Q4. And then we have a similar sister ship that we'll be delivering in Q1 fiscal year 2014., We have one situation that's being worked that's too hard for me to handicap. So not – I wouldn't want to mention any further aircraft activity., Okay. Thank you., Larry, it's Mike. What I included in my comments when I talked about Aviation Services was that we had the inventory item, and then we had lower margins sequentially at our Airfreight Maintenance facilities principally related to bringing in new work in Q3., Duluth and we also ramped up some new customers in Indianapolis, Larry., Yeah., They're busy. We've taken on some new lines of work for a particular customer that we're kind of in the learning curve on. But we expect to have – see that turn around here in Q4., It's better. It's – even though we've been talking about kind of sequential improvement and we've seen that, still not where we want it. But we have a leadership team in place there that's committed to getting the business so it's generating reasonable returns for us. So I would say that it's better and it continues to get better, but still not where we want it., So, what I mentioned, Larry, my comments in Technology Products was that the Cargo Systems business had a softer Q3., That's principally around timing of spares and some system shipments, which we expect to get back to more normal levels in Q4., In terms of forecast for that business for Q4?, No, no, no, we see a , The business has been performing very well for us, and particularly in helping us with our internal spend on programs. So we've been pleased with the performance of the business. The earn-out is mathematical formula and it was in both parties' interest to negotiate this conclusion., I think it's a little early, Larry. My view is that the U.S. Air team will inject some creative thinking into the American organization. So I'd be hopeful and somewhat optimistic, but I won't be at this stage factoring anything in., It's a little bit too early., Hey, J. B., Yeah, we touched on it actually, and Duluth is contributing. The shops, they're all very busy. We're ramping up some new programs across our various facilities that have a little bit of a drag on margins this quarter. We expect better margins next quarter. Duluth is I think been a terrific story in terms of going from a mothballed plant to a plant that has two lines of work going today. But still it's – we're looking for people and we want to get the ramp to three and then four lines as quickly as possible. But no, the MRO business is doing well. There's good demand for – as far as services. And our performance has been balanced very good., There are some interesting things, J. B. So we're kind of – we have our finger in – out there kind of in the mix, if you will. And I think what I'm saying is that any acquisitions we do will be to strengthen the leadership positions we have in the different markets we've been discussing. So anything that comes up that improves our supply chain deliverables, anything that improves our MRO capability, anything that improves our Cargo Systems, we'll be looking at those opportunities very closely., I think the airlines are watching their inventory levels very closely, and my sense is that you're probably going through a little bit of a burn down at present. And I would imagine that will – should continue for a short period, but then they'll probably get their inventory positioned – ready for the strong summer season they're expecting., Say again., I think as we sit here today, it's probably bottomed., Okay, great., Thanks, J. B., No problem., Yeah, I think it's a combination. I think we're – the business is giving us – continues to give us a good return on capital. And the business continues to operate efficiently. I believe that the requirements are down as a result of both factors you indicated. And we're planning on those requirements staying down for a period of time. So as we look at Q4, for instance, we don't see any major changes. You might have slightly up, slightly down, but nothing – no significant directional changes. And as we enter the new fiscal year, I think we're looking at relatively flat to where we are today. So we've been in this situation before with this business. We're a little bit I think stronger this cycle than we've been in other cycles, so I would anticipate that'll be a tough , No, I think it was fairly consistent throughout. I don't – I can't say that we saw any change. Keep in mind now, our historic – this quarter is a low quarter to begin with because you're dealing with the December, January and February period. So December is typically soft due to the holidays and February is soft because it only has 28 days. So historically, this has been our softest quarter. Now that said, we had nice growth over prior year and I think a lot of that is due to some of the stuff that we've been talking about in terms of our positioning and our customer interaction and our performance. So I think as we look out into Q4, I think if you look at our commercial growth rates versus many of our people also selling to the commercial markets over the last three or four years, it think you'll see that we've given a pretty good accounting for ourselves. So I would anticipate that that will continue., Good evening., We had strength in the quarter and we have made some investments in inventory for anticipated strength continuing into Q3 and Q4. So the business clearly had a dip in Q1. But it is not exactly where we want to be, but significantly higher than Q1. So Q2 was a good quarter. And we anticipate with some investments we briefly made here in Q2 that we would anticipate that we'll have some strength in Q3 and Q4., Julie, it's Tim. In this particular situation, we are really taking over the supply of consumable and expendable product for the airline, so everything from the sourcing of the parts to delivering it to the bins at the airline. So it's an extension of what we've been doing. And it's similar to what some of the others are doing. But it's an area that we're leveraging our systems, we're leveraging our relationships and we're leveraging our core capability., Yeah. So, Julie, it's John. Yeah. I mean look, as we've thought about it, this is obviously – there's been a lot of planning and analysis going in and particularly as we've gotten sort of more visibility around what airlift is going to do, right? I mean it has been a kind of particularly strong first half of the year. I think from our perspective you can kind of look at the aircraft positions and make a rough guesstimate as to how we think the business will impact in the back half of the year., It will get offset by positive contributions, particularly I think in the fourth quarter in the supply chain parts of our business. And also offset by some improvement in our Technology Products, specifically our commercial cargo loading and systems business, so positive supply chain, positive cargo loading services offsetting and mitigating some of the downward pressure that you're seeing from airlift., Thanks. Julie, you too., Yeah. So fiscal, starting the fiscal year, we had 40 positions., We lost a few positions between end of fiscal year and now. And then so we're expecting from fiscal year start to end where we had started with 40, of those 40, 20 are going to go away is our best estimate., Right. And then we believe between now and fiscal year-end we will win nine new positions., Yes., Yeah. We had lost some positions in Q2., Yes. Yes. And we're – yeah. So we're hoping that – we're expecting these protests to – we believe the protest is frivolous., And we believe that will be ruled in our favor., So those will be two that would go into Africa., We believe that we're probably going to win somewhere in the vicinity of four to five task orders in Afghanistan., And then we believe there's another two rotary wings that we'll win in Africa., Yeah, right., Yes, that's correct., That's our expectation of the first year performance. We do think that there's opportunities to build on that. Larry, just to maybe follow up a little bit on Julie's question too, I mean, we provide this kind of support for our own internal shops. It's just that we haven't had large programs like this with external customers, so it's something that we know very well and we expect that we can build off of this program with this customer and with other new customers., It's in the ZIP code, slightly smaller., But we prefer, I think at their request, we've , Yeah., Yeah, that'll take a little longer. Unison, of course, had a much broader range of customers. This has a narrower range. So I think it probably shouldn't take quite as long but there will be a ramp period., Yeah, I think it's a little bit less than that but it's clearly meaningful., The goal is to get to four and I think let's get through three., It's a manning challenge. And at this time of year, people aren't dying to fly up to Duluth , Summertime. Yeah, right, right., I think Q2 they ran strong. I think Q3, we get into the holiday season. You should expect some softness there., But typical, nothing unusual., Yeah. I think relatively flat, slightly down but not in a meaningful , Yeah. Yeah., Yeah., Yeah, no. I think that's fair, all right. It's softness around Precision and also in our cargo loading systems businesses. So it's Technology Products that kind of drove it. But you're correct. It's kind of flat to down like 1%., Yeah. And we have had improvement. So the Q2 is better than Q1. It's still, though, operating in the red I guess was my point. And we've gotten it – so the team operating the business now, we shifted the management in early summer and the business now reports to our mobility GM and who reports to Dany Kleiman who you may have met, Tyler. And Dany, before he left Israel Aircraft Industries was running their MRO business, BEDEK Aviation. But before that he was in charge of their manufacturing plant, building the airplane, the G250, as well as building parts for Boeing under contract., So they've put some disciplines in place which has already yielded improvements. We now have to win customer confidence back. And we did some – I made a comment about bonehead decision. The prior manager had made some pricing decisions that quite frankly pissed off some of the customers. So we're now trying to recover some of those customer relations and I think the key to recovering customer relations is doing a fabulous job on operational stuff., And so the guys are fixing the operation, which I think is getting close to where we want to be and now we have to regain the customer confidence and make them feel better about what we're doing and then probably give some price concessions so that we regain their trust., Absolutely. And it should be. And it's really – I mean, I got to watch my language because I'm not happy about it. But we really have, to put it mildly, stubbed our toe. I mean this is, of all our different subset markets, this is probably the healthiest of all the markets. So we should be enjoying some of what's going on in the build cycle in this business and we're not. So we've got to fix it. We know what we have to do. I have confidence in the team that we have in place today to fix it and I would hope that next year at this time while we're talking here will be contributive to the profitability and hopefully additive to margins., Well, there's probably seven assets that we would probably look to sell and because one of the things that we'd like to do is simplify the fleet. So at one point in time we're operating nine aircraft type and if we sell these three aircraft type, we've already gotten rid of one aircraft type, we'd be down to two fixed-wing type, de Havilland Dash 8 and CASA 212s and then we'd be down to three rotary wings, which would be the S-92s, the S-61s and the Pumas. So that would be ideal state for us. But let's see with that. One of the aircraft that we have out, the CASA 235, so we actually have some requirements for, so we're arm wrestling as to whether we want to – what we want to do exactly with those requirements., Yeah. The book value is $30 million and we think the market value is pretty close to that level., And hey, Tyler, if you're still there, the value I gave you includes all the spares that support those , Yeah., Good evening., There aren't really any significant startup costs. We will be putting a team in place. We're going to be warehousing this out of one of our existing facilities. We're going to take on some additional space in that facility. We'll invest a little bit of capital to mezzanine the shipping area. In terms of the provisioning of the inventory we will be and have started issuing purchase orders, so there'll be working capital investment. But no costs or startup costs that are significant that would have a negative impact on margin., Yeah. It's part of the reason for our taking a softer look at the second half earnings because we had originally been anticipating that those task orders would have been issued by now and that we'd have the benefit of those at this operating in Q3. We're now a little bit – we're taking a more cautious view and thinking it's going to take a little longer because we still don't have the task orders to go ahead and deploy those assets., Yeah. It's called government., Well, longer term, it depends on what you're talking about, right, in terms of longer term. I mean at some point in time – obviously, today in Duluth we're doing their A320 fleet. I would expect that the order from Boeing was to replace some of those assets. I'm not sure – I don't recall, although I believe I did see it. But I don't recall when those aircraft come into the Air Canada fleet., Yeah. So I think as they phase in, I don't know how many a year of – what did they order, 69 or..., Yeah. So I think there are 80 A320s currently in the fleet, if I remember correctly. So I would imagine that over time they'll be transitioning A320s out and probably transitioning 737s in., Absolutely. I'd have to check the stats to know if we can handle three or four. But we will definitely be able to handle at least three., Hey, J.B., Yeah. I think we should see inventory turns in that program of 3 to 4 times. Maybe not right at the start, but I think it should have decent turns., It moves around, some a little more than that. But, yeah, it's starting to get into a pretty good ramp here. So yeah, it goes up from here., Correct., Yeah. Let me, if I may, you made a comment about the terms and the investment for those programs. Let me also add one more thing and we mentioned it in the question that Julie asked about some of our businesses in the spare parts arena. We did in this quarter generate meaningful positive cash flow and cash flow in excess of our net after tax earnings. And keep in mind that that includes a significant investment in inventory to support our supply chain business. So we increased our supply chain inventory about approximately $20 million that should go ahead and augur well for Q3 and Q4 in that business. So the cash flows take into consideration investments in inventory to support the growth of the business., Absolutely., Yeah. Clearly, as you know, we're supporting and growing our supply chain, looking to support and grow our supply chain businesses, so there will be capital applied to those businesses and I signaled in my strategic overview some additional things that we're looking to do to build out our capabilities. So we're feeling pretty good about where we stand right now in terms of opportunities for capital deployment., And it helps that we generated the kind of cash that we have over the last year, year-and-a-half., Evening, Jon., Yeah., It was a fairly thin margin transaction. I think we may have announced or I don't recall precisely if we announced the sales and we may be prohibited from doing that, but it was a relatively thin margin transaction. One of the things that we're trying to secure there, keep in mind that they're headquartered – their air operation is at the Oklahoma City airport where we have our maintenance operation and it would be our goal/ambition to do the maintenance support for that fleet of aircraft., Six., Yeah, I'd like to get them done by the end of the quarter if we could, but I don't think that's going to happen. I think, realistically, I think that we have two 767s on lease with United. Those come down nicely. I'm not sure yet, I think those expire in 2016 or 2017., 2015 and 2016., 2015 and 2016?, Yes., So I'm not sure if we've heard from United yet as to what their intentions might be at that phase. Keep in mind they've invested fairly heavily in the interiors on that aircraft, so just not sure what their plan is. And then we have a 747 on lease with Delta that they have plans to operate for a long time. I guess we have that in a financed category now. And so, yeah, I would say that I would anticipate this fleet will move out of our portfolio in the next three or four years., Yeah. Thank you, Jon., Well, first of all, I think it's good for the industry. I think it has a potential of being positive for us. The US Air management team is integrating, I think, well with the American management team and I would expect that, as the time goes on, they'll be looking at their maintenance spend and trying to figure out how to do that most efficiently. And I would hope that they would view AAR as somebody who can assist them in that regard. We do business today in support of US Air. We do less business in support of American, but we would be optimistic that we'd be able to convince them that we offer competitive solutions for them., Well, they have a heavy – one of their core markets would be the Miami market. And we have a maintenance facility at the Miami airport. So that would be very conducive. And I think that the wide-body facility we have in Louisiana, although not necessarily right on their network, I'm certain they have lots of airplanes that fly over that location. So it's not totally inconvenient. It's not perfect because it's probably not on a route network. But it's probably not totally inconvenient. So yeah, our facilities I think are in a good physical location for their business., Yes. It's a large – it will be meaningful for the supply chain businesses. It wouldn't be a – it's not a deal changer kind of large. It's a very affordable opportunity. So I would imagine that we would actually pay for it out of our cash account. And yeah, I think that's about it, Stan., It's a goal of ours. We continue to stay focused around it. This quarter we struggled a little bit in terms of the gross margins. But you can see we continue to manage our SG&A. And it gave us a slight improvement in operating margins. We didn't have a needle mover but, as we continue to go through the portfolio and assess our different businesses and where we'd want to put more emphasis, it would be our goal to improve operating margins., Yes., Thank you., Yeah. I think free cash flow for the balance of the year will be under a little bit of pressure because we just made this acquisition of the cargo system product line over in Germany. And we have won these recent supply chain deals which will require capital investment. So our internal goal, up until some of these investments we've made, has been what you've indicated. The second half of the year, it might be a little bit harder to achieve that. So that would be cash flow from operations, we're still expecting that number to continue to do well, but we might be a little challenged on free cash flow., So, Julie, the answer is yes, we would, but we have to get into the black first, because if you multiply by a loss, there's no real multiple. So we've got to get our act together in the business and we've got the right team on it and we will get it fixed., Yes., Now, first of all, I wouldn't comment on it but we did look at it., Okay., Thanks, Julie., Hi, Larry., Hi, Larry., Yeah. We feel pretty good commercial markets. We think we had a good year. We have a fair amount of initiatives underway. We have more visibility to opportunities than we've had in the past. So yeah, I think that the commercial markets look okay., Yeah, our sense is that our customers are doing well., Not quite there this year. I think, we should start hitting that target this year. We're coming up to in the following year. But we do have a nice progress from year one to year two. And we would expect that progress – there is no reason to believe that progress won't continue into year three and on to year four., Yeah, the – so the Colombian deal was we took two commercial aircraft and we converted one into a freighter, full freighter and we converted one into a combi, which is part freighter, part passenger. We delivered the first aircraft in Q4. It had a – not a significant impact on earnings. It had good impact on cash because we utilized some assets that we had in stock to go on the – to fit on to the aircraft and so we converted some inventory into cash. But we still had margins, but it was still a profitable transaction contributed to the quarter's result., And then the second aircraft delivered this month, earlier this month to the customer and had a little bit better margin than the first aircraft. And yeah, I think it was a good transaction for the company where we've also received some follow-on business and we have a reason to believe that there may be more business opportunities for the company with the customer. They're very pleased with the progress. They showcased both the aircraft at their air show on July 11 this month, and the aircraft will be on show at a Chilean air show in March next year., This is a very critical component for us, so we're working very hard. Compensation plans are tied to cash flow generation. So the businesses are very focused on turning lazy assets into cash, as well as generating better margins and better throughput. So, hard for me to quantify precisely if we get to the same level, but I think directionally we'll be in the same zip code., We will not have the same kind of Yo-Yo effect that we've had in prior years when we've had successful cash generation. We believe this cash flow will be steady., Will it be exactly these levels, Larry? Maybe not, but they will be solid. You should see solid cash flow numbers coming from the company this year., Yes. The upside will be in the flight hours, so we've taken a conservative look at the flight hours as a result of what we've experienced the last six months. And so we're forecasting fairly low aircraft utilization. And our revenue from the flight hours comes through the utilization of the number of flight hours that they operate. So we have modeled in very low hours. If we get a pick up as a result of the movement of assets away from Afghanistan or if there's a buildup in Syria or a place like – or something like that, then we would expect the business to be more profitable than the 0% that we now have baked in., No., No, the customer has not. First of all, our customer is Northrop Grumman. Northrop Grumman's customer is the Air Force., We have had indirect contact with the Air Force, but most of our contact is directly through Northrop, and they do not have visibility precisely as to why or visibility as to what we should be expecting., Now, what we've done is we've looked at the flight hours going back since 1998 and that is as far back as we can get records. And we have been forecasting average usage in the fleet and we've been a little bit disappointed or surprised at the actual usage, which is at this historical low level. So we think we took a prudent action at this point in time, and if the flight hours resume to historical levels, then this segment of the contract will be once again will be profitable., No, I think what we've seen is we've operated the aircraft much more efficiently than we have in the past. So you may recall, J.B., when we bought this business, we felt there was about $25 million of income on the table that could be assumed once we were able to put some disciplines in place and keep the aircraft operationally ready. And the team lead by Randy Martinez has done a remarkable job this past year in having those aircraft in a ready position. So the growth that we've had is really actually with fewer aircraft in theatre, we've had a significant growth in sales and in income coming from that business., Absolutely. We've actually freed up some assets that we can possibly apply elsewhere or, if not, sell., There is additional demand actually as we sit here today, there is a demand that's been identified in Afghanistan, so there is an RFP. It's on the street to support the Afghan nationals. So we're in there with the bid and hopefully we'll have news in the next few weeks. Other than that, we are looking for other places where we can get utilization and take some market share there. As we've talked about before, there is a pretty broad and varied application for this kind of capability across different government entities and it would be our intention to go ahead and compete and capture some of that business., We're talking about the aircraft leasing portfolio now?, Yeah, J.B., there's six aircraft in total. Two of the aircraft are wholly-owned and there are four aircraft that are owned under joint venture., J.B., also keep in mind now, these aircraft that we've been talking about that we traded here with the U.S. Marshals Service and with the Colombians, were aircrafts that we did not own before we made these transactions. So these are not – these aircrafts do not come from our inventory. They're aircraft that we sourced, purchased, fixed, and then in some cases, modified and then sold., So for the tax rate, we're thinking in the 34% to 35% range, which is where we historically have been not withstanding some of the benefits that we've had from some of the state tax planning strategies we've incorporated over the last couple of years. In terms of interest, it's fairly steady with the fourth quarter interest level., Maybe slightly higher., Thanks, J.B., Yeah., Yeah, yeah. We should have revenue – we could have revenue as early as Q1, but we will have that revenue in Q2. The program as you said is they're very close. They have not delivered the first aircraft, which is MSN7 to the French Air Force yet. But they are planning to do that pretty much any day now., It should happen before this month is out actually. So yeah, we've made a lot of progress on that program., So as we see it now, based on the price that we have per system, we did have a re-negotiation with Airbus that we completed here recently. In that renegotiation, we have identified kind of the scope of work that we will now be doing, which is slightly less than the original scope. And then we have a pricing which is very similar to the pricing we had for the full scope. We anticipate that over the life of the program, we will recover our investment through the selling price that we have. We also will have spare sales. We've had some already. We had some that went into Q4 and we anticipate additional spare sales throughout the fiscal year., Yeah, that's correct. That's correct. Yeah, you should solid cash flows as we sell A400M systems, correct., The fixed wing are booked all the way through a very large percentage of fixed wing are booked all the way through May of next year, so May of 2014. There are the rotary wing contract, one contract that expires in November, and one contract is up for an option year in October. We have a high level of confidence that a large percentage of those assets, even the ones that come off contract will be transferred over to the contract that still has option years remaining. At least that's our intel as we sit here today., 22?, There is a – I should know, 19, 2 and 2, so 20..., 24., 24 in Afghanistan approximately, okay? We can get you the exact number., No, one in contract, the contracts are for multiple..., Yeah, the contracts are for multiple aircrafts. We have it laid out in our 10-K and we can get you that data here very easily. I just don't have it right this minute., Yeah., Thank you., Well, let's see Middle East is in terms of the – we've opened up an office in Abu Dhabi to capture more commercial business in the Middle East. So where my head is kind of going in the Middle East right now is to try to figure out how we take advantage of their order book and be in a position to support their growing fleet. So that's the first thing comes to mind when I think Middle East., Secondly, of course, is Middle East as it relates to U.S. activity, today, we do virtually no business in support of the State Department in Iraq, although there are certain opportunities to do business in support of that customer. We are not currently participating. If we think of Afghanistan and the Middle East, we have a significant presence there with our Airlift operation., Our mobility business, which in the past has supported U.S. operations in moving supplies into that theatre, has been softened by the reduction in activity. And then we have recently won a contract supporting the Saudi Arabia, an effort in Saudi Arabia where we've our C4I business is providing some integration work as is our container – our mobility business providing some shelter., So I believe that the Middle East continues to be an area of opportunity for the company. We've invested by opening up an office as I indicated in Abu Dhabi. We're staffing that office with one of our senior marketing types and we've had some good success. I might add also that that office is also handling our activities in Africa and we have had some success most notably in Kenya, but we're also touching other potential customers in the Africa region. So for this company, that territory, from a commercial vantage point, has been relatively negligible in terms of results and we have some optimism that that will be a productive region for the company., Yeah, well I don't think, its improvement as much as we don't think there is going to be a lot more decay. So we think we've – the major piece – you've got two major pieces in that sector. You have the mobility business, which historically has been AAR's strongest piece of its technology business, and that business has suffered from reductions in activity in support of U.S. government movement of troops and supplies. I think Mike indicated on a year-over-year basis, we had a revenue decline of $47 million, but I did also indicate that that's going to – continues to be a profitable business., But our Telair and our commercial cargo systems business is relatively strong, it's strong. We're on some very good platforms. We continue to support virtually all Airbus manufactured aircraft and we have a position on the 747-8 aircraft. So we think the commercial cargo business is decent. Is it gangbusters? No, but it's decent. And then we have, as we alluded to from the last questioner, we will start making deliveries of A400M cargo systems this year, and those are approximately $1.5 million per unit., Okay., Thanks., 
            , I think on the defense side, we've had some success here recently, creating some of these unique aircraft solutions for customers. And we continue to kind of canvas the world to see whom else might be interested in that kind of lower-cost solution. And whether we can close something and deliver within the next fiscal year or not might be a question, but I do believe that we will have continued success doing that kind of activity., So, yeah, I think you'll see good growth out of commercial markets. Our defense markets business should hold its own, notwithstanding any other dramatic cuts to budgets. And, yeah, I think that's where you'll see the action., Well, the maintenance business as we sit here today on this call, we have a capacity problem, right, because we don't have a lot more space. We have some space. We can accommodate some additional demand, but we couldn't accommodate a dramatic requirement as we sit here today. Now, we're thinking about how we deal with that and we're trying to create – we're trying to open up some space, so to speak. But at this moment as we sit here today, it would be hard for us to digest a meaningful slug of airframe business., Now, we do think that we have a better shot at improving some of the component activity. We have – American has not been a significant customer for the company over the years. U.S. Air, we've had decent relationships with U.S. Air. We do landing gear repairs, we do component repairs, we sell them some parts., So as the two businesses merge and as U.S. Air leadership moves into a more prominent role in the merged entity, we think that there'll be some opportunities for the company. I can't comment on the – when you talk about short-term, we're not baking in any short-term pickup, meaningful pickup. So I think longer-term, I think it bodes well for the company., Yeah, I think that there are a few different parameters that go into that decision. So when you look at last year, we generated a significant amount of cash. We used some of that to pay down our debt, so we feel very pleased with the improvement in our debt-to-equity position. We used some of that to pay down – to buy in stock. And so if you see the average purchase price of our stock, 1 million shares at $14.90 a share. And then we took some of the cash and we invested it back in the business. And I think as we look forward, I think there will be a combination we'll apply to capital., We still have – we have about $35 million remaining on our authorization from the board's purchase in shares. I think that's probably – that's an option. I believe continue to pay down debt is important to us. I think we'll probably at some point in time take a look at the at the board level, take a look at the dividend and see how we feel about that. And I think obviously returning capital and giving our shareholders a good return on their capital is important to us. So we will continue to explore all these things. Acquisitions are also in the mix as well. So there are a few different things that we're looking at that fit in strategically very well with what we're doing and we may be in a position to pull the trigger there., As we sit here today in the month of July, we had a very good cash generation, a good month in June. Our net debt position has improved from year end, at $91 million improvement in net debt. We knocked off another $40 million of debt improvement. So when you look at June of 2012 versus June of 2013, our net debt is down $130 million. So we will continue to focus on all the different places we can use the capital., 
            , So I believe that we will continue to look for good deals as they present themselves. I think I indicated some of objectives that we have for the year. So if opportunities present themselves that match up with things we're trying to do then, we may pull the trigger., Thank you. Thanks for your questions., Well, we've got – Larry, we've got some converts that mature – converts that mature I think in February, late February, early March..., So that comes out later on in the year., Yeah., No, but Larry, I think you're looking at it correctly., I'd be surprised if it doesn't go beyond 2014., Yes., It's interesting, it does impact gross profit. There was a portion of it that we were required to reduce revenues, and then the rest of it went to cost of sales. But the important part is that it all impacts gross profit., Right, because there is a – when you adjust for the impact, the sales would have been a little higher., So I think that's why you're probably off., Okay, okay., Hi, Larry., Yes, our view is, first of all, yes, to some degree, we're expecting a stronger quarter. We had a few customers who deferred heavy engine business for instance., And therefore pushed off some of the activity into Q2, but we are expecting to recover the shortfall from Q1 into Q2, Q3 and Q4. We also mentioned in our press release, we didn't mentioned in the conference call script, but we – and that's just something we missed, but we are reaffirming full-year guidance on sales and earnings., I think that's – I think, Larry, if you look back two years ago this quarter, we had sales about $490 million., So, I think last year, we did have a strong quarter. We had a couple of individual situations that caused that to be. But – and so, we did expect higher sales this summer from our supply chain, but it's not – we do expect that. What we did – what did get pushed off based on what our customers are telling us, we do expect to recover that business in the out quarters., Yeah, I mean, I think that we're – we feel pretty good about how the quarter is starting. And as we've mentioned also, we will be delivering two aircrafts this quarter. So, we are expecting a fairly solid quarter., It's very different than any other facility that we have. So, you're dealing with the – each hangar is capable of handling wide-body aircraft. And the – we view the capacity increase as approximately 7 wide-body and 10 narrow-body aircraft. We have received provisional authorization from the FAA to do work on aircraft that are currently in the hangar and we're in the queue to get the full FAA license. So, we're very early in that and the – in our involvement and it's a little bit hard to predict precisely what the ramp might be, but I would imagine that within – by a year from now, we'll have a much steadier – first of all, a much more visibility, and I think we'll have a steady contributing business to our profitability., So, we only received the provisional certification on August 30th. So, we're not even a month into the – into having the operation. We have over 100 mechanics and we are doing work on four customer aircraft and we are today looking to hire more mechanics and hopefully, we have a fully operational business by the end of the calendar year., Some of it is structural in nature., And some of – keep in mind, last year, we're operating more facilities, we closed a couple of facilities last year. So, some is structural in nature and – but the preponderance of savings is around the sharp focus around spend. So, we're watching travel, we're watching freight, we're watching office supplies, shop supplies, and we're looking at critical materials to go into some of our manufacturing businesses. So, I think it's pretty much across the board. And I believe the effort is gaining momentum., Yeah., Hi, Julie., Well, I think we always – we prefer to be undercommitted and overdelivered and I think it's our preferred approach. So, yeah, I mean, I think we feel that we're giving the appropriate guidance based on what we know, and we hope that we perform well against that guidance and exceed it where we can., No, no, no, no, we had indicated that we had at least one or two more quarters and we anticipate that we'd pretty well level out at the end of this – the period we just ended. So, we don't anticipate much more in the way of decline, very minor decline in Q2, which would be better than what we had previously communicated., I think if the Air Force goes the route of taking the KC-10 fleet down, they will do that as they take on new KC-46s, I believe the number is, and so at least that's the way it's been explained to us by Northrop Grumman. And, of course, those deliveries don't start out I think until, what, 2015 or 2016 and there is a few a year. And by the time these aircraft are out of service, our contract will have expired., Yeah, we're just trying to answer your question., The – I think we'll have to do the math to figure it out. But I'd say that if we would have had the sales that we were expecting, we would have at least had flat commercial sales, but I think maybe..., It would have been actually..., Actually commercial sales – we just checked, commercial sales would have been stronger..., Yeah., ...had what you mentioned happened., Keep in mind, the decline was relatively modest. So, decline is less than – right around 1%, a little bit over 1%. So, the sales that got deferred, had those sales happened – had we hit those targets, then we would have exceeded – we would have had commercial sales growth, yes., Tyler, I mean – this is Mike – that amount going forward is going to be reasonably modest. It's not going to be any more – it should not – we don't expect it to be any more than that amount in Q2, Q3, and Q4, so relatively modest number., There is no – there is no difference in our aircraft portfolio from year-end. We have, I think, four aircraft owned in joint venture and then two aircraft in our wholly-owned portfolio., I think we'll have some knowledge next week. We're expecting some knowledge next week. But there is a lot of shuffling, if you will, in terms of different possibilities and outcomes. So, we're in touch with the four-star levels. And I think there is a little bit of – I think they're trying to move things around and aren't really ready right at this moment to commit. But we anticipate some commitments as early as next week., Well, I think we still like to have a better balance to our fleet. So, we still do worry about it and think about it. And we are offering assets into other markets. So, yes, we continue to work that pretty actively. And I would say that the deal pipeline in both regards in the current theatre as well as some adjacent – other markets is fairly brisk at this moment., But there is a fair amount of uncertainty coming from the customer in terms of what their actual requirements might be., We may not buy. We may lease or we may figure out another way to get to use that customer equipment et cetera. So, we're looking at a few different possibilities., Tyler, I mean, I think you should think about our CapEx – so we had a little over $7 million this quarter sort of in that $30 million to $40 million range for the year, notwithstanding anything unusual. I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question?, On the free cash flow front, I mean what we talked about – what we've talked about fairly consistently over the last 12 months is identifying as our target, free cash flow equal to our net income and we've delivered on that, we've exceeded that in the last several quarters. So, I think the way to think about that is equal to our net income., Very minor. But, yes, I think it's more of a drain at this moment than contributor., No, not really significant., So, Jon, I think that there is kind of – part of our thinking today is kind of looking a little bit more externally towards investments in deals. We're also looking at investing in program activity to support some of our supply chain initiatives. So, I think the free cash flow picture could change as a result of one or two of these events occurring. But in the meantime, we continue to drive the existing businesses to generate as much cash flow from operations as they can., And that energy will continue. And, hopefully, we'll be able to find good places to invest some of this capital we've been generating., We're focused on EBITDA, the total to..., ...the net debt. And I think we're making a nice dent in that and get that ratio right and then we'll be kind of more apt to get more aggressive externally., I think it might – yeah, it's possible you'll see some stuff happening in 2014., Yeah., In terms of hangar capacity..., Just kind of in general, it was a reasonably strong quarter for the MROs. During the summer, the inputs are always a little bit lighter., But they performed very well. As we go into the balance of the fiscal year, the story gets a little bit tighter. But I'd say the first quarter was normal. We had some capacity but were able to flex the workforce, things like that, to adjust for it, so..., It's positive in terms of the number of hours produced across the facilities., They look strong., Yep., Julie, the sales – there was a sales decline in defense right around 7% and the sales decline in commercial was right around 6%., I mean, not at my fingertips., Yeah., Commercial, I believe, was up 14%. Commercial was up 14% and defense was down 10%., So, we continue to work through and address our issues there. And we feel like going into the second quarter, our performance will be significantly better than the first quarter and the last – actually the last few quarters. So, I think we're making progress on it, Larry, and I think – like I said, I think this quarter we should start to see some meaningful results from our efforts., I'd be disappointed if it's not positive."
1004,2014.0,Q&A,a,"No. Now, that was kind of one-off related to a transaction we did overseas, but we haven't done a similar type of adjustment this year., We did have this one-time adjustment that we talked about in the press release, but our effective tax rate is going to remain at 34.5% going forward., Yeah, so we have actually already started on the unnamed customer, we have obviously made investments and then we've made some investments in advance for the Sabena transaction. When you look at this quarter, we actually did invest pretty heavily on our growth both for our sort of traditional transaction business, but also these programs to give you an idea, the order of magnitude and as you probably know, this doesn't really run through our CapEx line, but we spent about $27 million between the two, between parts and engines over the course of this quarter. So, we are going to have to continue to make some investments, but we are going to sequence through and we think these things give us the right returns going forward., Hey, Julie., Hi, Julie., Well, I'd say first of all, let's get through FY 2014, and I think that we are trying to share with you that we are positioning ourselves with some of these new contract wins to give us a little bit more dependable revenue base, if you will. This is an unusual period for us, because historically we have been able to replace business. I am not sure and I am trying to, I guess, get a handle around the impact that the weather may have had in terms of disrupting some of our operations, because it was a little bit unusual in terms of not being able to win certain new business that in an ad hoc nature that we typically would have won. So, I believe we have fairly good visibility. Clearly, we're disappointed here in terms of this quarter's results, but yeah, I think that as we come into July, we should have pretty good visibility., No, this is purely compared to prior year, and they should have a very decent fourth quarter., Right., Right., We're going to have some cash going out on the balance of the Sabena deal. So I think as we ramp in some of these new contracts, there will be some cash going out. As I look out into next year assuming purely from the standpoint of our existing customer, our existing business space, I would expect our free cash to exceed our after-tax income. So I expect to be over that 100% number that we have experienced in the last eight quarters as you mentioned. So I think we should be generating some pretty good cash flows next year., Yeah. Lake Charles has been inactive of late. We completed the contracts that were there when we took on the business, and now we are bidding work. But as we sit here today we haven't had any success yet., But I think everybody has to be just a little bit patient, only because we just got the FAA certification in September, and we're trying to figure out how to go ahead and entice people there in a way that we can still make a buck on it. So be a little patient; look back on Indianapolis. The first couple years of our Indianapolis adventure we were mostly vacant. Eventually we got some business, and we've been able to grow it from there. So we still believe that we are positioned well there, we just need a little bit more time to break into some accounts., Yep., No, it does not., Yeah, so we'll start making investment in that this quarter., And then there'll be a ramp in investment over the next two-year period as the EJs start coming into the fleet., Yes. Yes., So I believe, they get to the 30 aircrafts in three years, if I'm not mistaken. And so once you get to that point that should stay relatively constant. So as the aircrafts come into the fleet, the revenue kicks in. But once you get to year three, the aircraft will be starting to require their C checks as well. So I would say you probably get to full ramp by year five would be my guess., Because by then the aircraft would have been in service, all the aircraft would have been in service, and all the aircraft would have been through at least one C check., There will be some, and it is in the guidance. So obviously there'll be some severance related for some people that'll be departing the firm. And that's probably the bulk of it. But it's in the guidance., I'd rather not. But if you were to..., Hey, Tyler, if I may, let me go back to the question on Mesa for a second. And..., So the current agreement that Mesa has with the United Express is for 30 aircrafts. I believe Mesa is optimistic that as they perform and United Express looks to grow their ERJ fleet, that they'll get more aircrafts under their contract and so there might be follow-on work there as well. Just kind of file that away if you don't mind., I think that's a good way to look at it, I believe. And this contract we negotiated not just with Mesa, but also with United, and United is clearly in better shape today than they were, let's say, last go around. So, yeah, my belief is that you have brand new equipment, the 70-seaters as opposed to the 50-seaters, and our view is that we should be protected on the assets. And time will tell, of course., Well, you know, Tyler, David mentioned that we're expecting improvements at mobility in the fourth quarter and I think you should actually see more of the same as we go forward there., Well, you know, the NATO 18 contract was released. We were advised which aircraft we were going to get and then with the political turmoil and elections and our government's inability to work with Karzai just put everything on hold. We're hopeful that with a new government coming into Afghanistan that we'll start to see these aircraft start to be activated. But I don't know if that's going to be in April or July, or when. So it's pretty tough to predict a ramp there, and we haven't really been successful to date on predicting when these things will kick in., In terms of next year, you know there's a series of opportunities, some onesie, twosie and then one in particular that's very, very large and I think we last quarter called it a game-changer, and that would be, take most of next fiscal year to work through, get awarded, and start to come into play. And quite frankly, we haven't even seen the final RFP on that yet. So we're looking to see some more aircraft come out of the portfolio as we go into fiscal 2015 and then start to put more aircraft in, in these – by winning some of these competitions that we're bidding today., These things have a way of kind of building off of each other, so we're hopeful that by securing the Sabena inventory – the Sabena programs for instance, but that will lead to additional business in that theatre. They, Sabena, have not been investing in this business the last few years. So in talking with the people in the business unit, we have a sense that we can possibly win some additional business in that region. So I think what I was trying to signal in my commentary was as a result of some of these wins, the airline expendable win, the Eaton win, the Sabena win, that there will be more of this kind of activity in each one of those streams coming forward., Well, when we won that contract, if you may recall, there was an ex-airline maintenance base that was providing the maintenance. And again, it's one of those situations where we're not supposed to be discussing who the airline is, but I'll explain it to you and you might be able to get to the conclusion. But basically, the MRO that was supporting the airline went bankrupt. And they had at the time, they were holding a fair amount of that airline's inventory. So, there was no way to price a power, and they had been operating under a power-by-the-hour agreement., We couldn't price the power-by-the-hour, nor did they want us to, so we worked on a time and material basis for a year. And so we could get the power-by-the-hour agreement, so we could gain more knowledge and then negotiate a power-by-the-hour agreement. So it was always intended to go power-by-the-hour, it was just a temporary expedient to go time and material. So this was always planned. In the process of going power-by-the-hour, it drives a less revenue number, but the profitability is approximately the same., Yeah, I mean, look, they're available for sale now. I don't know if we can give you a real prediction as to when we would expect this stuff to be sold. But some of them are back in the U.S., some of them are in transit back to the U.S., and then some of them are actually going to be moved to a location in the Middle East where we think we might have a better chance at marketing them. So we're pushing hard to get something done this quarter. It's not a certainty, but certainly over the next six months., Yeah, I mean, the nine that we have for sale right now are on the books for about $18.8 million., The expectation is to make a gain., Hi, John., Well, okay. So, we talked about this a little bit, but yeah. To compare it on an apples-to-apples basis, you have to make an adjustment to third quarter of last year's number because there was a acquisition adjustment made in that. So when you add back to last year's number that sort of $9 million that was a part of that, actually our SG&A fell by about $5 million., 
            , Right., Correct., So we have lots of liquidity. At the quarter close, we had close to $400 million available, and that's prior to any incremental accordion draw or anything else. So..., Yeah. Right., Yep. Go ahead, , No. I mean, we're making baby step progress, and we keep working it., Nothing that I can see at this moment, but we continue to work it., So assuming that the general economy were to grow at, let's call it for argument's sake, 3%, I would expect our growth rate to be around 10%., Yeah., I wouldn't say moving into Europe. We've been in Europe. I think we're kind of increasing our investments in Europe, yes., Well, let us kind of play around with that and let us give some thought to that before we comment, and then get back to you on that. Because we didn't make this acquisition with that in mind, but clearly we have actually – in Aviation, there's a fair amount of folks who base in Dublin for that purpose. So let us kind of play around with that and see if that's an option for us. We haven't talked about it; we don't really know at this stage if that's meaningful for us., Now let me just add, though, that, although the operation is headquartered in Brussels, keep in mind now also, one of the motivations is to increase our Middle East and Africa business where fleet sizes are growing., Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes., Yes, yes., Well, we'll take that constructively and let us go to work on that, and then we'll let you know. Okay?, Well, we didn't delay it for any real reason. We've still been looking or thinking about acquisitions. We feel a lot more courageous today with a stronger balance sheet position, and we do see some opportunities. Obviously my preference is to grow organically, and I think in this quarter, although we kind of didn't perform from a sales standpoint, we did perform from a standpoint of winning some new business contracts. So my preference would be organic growth, and we will look to supplement that organic growth with what we consider to be appropriate acquisitions. We do have a couple of, one acquisition in particular, which will give us -one acquisition candidate I should say, which should give us some additional possibilities for new revenue streams. And we're looking at that situation very closely today., Thank you., Thank you, sir., Yeah. So airlift has probably taken a little bit further move down, not meaningfully as it has, say, last year over the prior year, but it continues to be challenged. As it relates to airlift, it's a little unpredictable at this stage because we are responding to a fair amount of RFQs. And I still remain relatively optimistic that we can have nice successful performance coming out of business. But keep in mind, Larry, last year this quarter and last year, the performance was exceptional., And we would need more positions to go – we'll have to get a tremendous increase in usage to approximate last year's performance. So we're not counting only last year's performance to be duplicated, but we do see – we see next quarter also or the quarter that we're currently in being a little tough because the Africa positions we're going to – we were hopeful – we were awarded those in last fiscal year, we were hopeful that that work would have kicked in Q1. It didn't because of the protests. As I indicated, the protests have been cleared, but the work doesn't begin until November 1 on one of the contracts, and December on the other contracts. So as we sit here planning right now, we're thinking Q2 is kind of a trough period and that we start seeing an uptick in Q3 and Q4., Yeah. So we see the African market expanding. So we see opportunities there. We see more opportunities around supporting the Navy and we will be deploying some assets for additional Navy contracts here shortly. So yeah, I think we see a nice pool of opportunities. Of course, we've had a fair amount of aircraft come back at us, so some of that we didn't expect and some of that we did expect. But yeah, I think the team is looking at quite a few opportunities. The State Department opportunity is very sizable. And hopefully, we'll give a good accounting for ourselves in this bidding process. But of course, on that one, it's the winner takes all, either you win it or you don't; and if we'd win it, it's pretty and if we don't win it, it's not., That's exactly right. So we're out there. The guys are slugging away. Just to be clear, still profitable business and still making a nice contribution, just at the levels it has in the past. And it's hard for us to make up for the dip across our businesses, although we did to some extent., Yeah. It's a smaller transaction, that's a different customer base, but it's a nice piece of business. It leverages our relationships there., And it will ramp here fairly quickly., Hi, Tyler., So we are thinking that the low point is this quarter in the 19 range. We may come off a couple here in November and then we replace with others elsewhere. So we have a few more coming back from Afghanistan, but then we have a few going out to Africa. So we are expecting by Q3 to be at 23 aircrafts., No. We're looking at the Q2 being relatively flat with Q1, is how we are seeing it., So as we're sitting here today, we're strong in Oklahoma, Duluth, Miami, and Indianapolis. We have a room for improvement at Lake Charles and in Hot Springs., Yeah. Tim, maybe you can answer that., So Lake Charles is in good shape in terms of our outlook and our commitments from our customers. What we're doing there is, some of the work that we're doing now is lighter hours as we kind of get our burn-in set. And then as we go into the second half of the fiscal year with additional aircraft that come on with heavier manpower utilization, then we'll see that ramp up more significantly., But in terms of actual iron in the facility, we're in good shape. It's just that the hours that we're working on now are light compared to some of the other facilities., So there are 15 aircrafts that we have determined are for sale. Those aircraft are for the most part fairly niche oriented aircrafts. So it's the type of asset that, if you add the right asset when somebody needs it, it's very valuable. And we've had a series of discussions with prospective customers. We've got to do a better job on remarketing. The team has been very focused on repositioning aircraft into different theatres. But we're in the process of trying to on-board a individual to go ahead and have exclusive responsibility of the remarketing of these aircraft. We don't have that person on-board right now. Right now we're handling it through purchasing department down there. We don't have a aircraft sales department, but as a result of the buildup of inventory we will be focused on that., Thank you., Yeah. So you might note that we also commented that we made investments in our supply chain businesses. So we have net increase in investment capital, even though our return on capital is up 400 basis points. We have a net increase in investment capital there of approximately $25 million. So yeah, we're looking to fund – invest, if you will, in the growth of those businesses. So there's a little pressure short-term here on cash, but I think we're investing it wisely., Welcome., Yeah. No, we've never really sized that business precisely. So I don't think it's in our public information. So I think the way that we've been sizing it is really around the number of positions we may change. We may decide to do that differently, but for now at least, J.B., we're sizing it by the number of aircrafts., And, J.B., just to be clear, as per competitive purposes, we know we have a leadership position and we're not looking to educate our competitors., Well, we should start seeing contribution this quarter., Yes. That's correct., Thank you., Sure., Yeah. So, hey, Kevin, it's John. I mean, look, there were a number of aircraft positions tied to some contracts that we thought we were going to get awarded and we got a high level of confidence, but over the last 30 days to 45 days, the situation has deteriorated and we no longer think that those contracts are going to materialize, right? So ultimately, what we're losing nine slots to that, but then we're picking up an incremental four, right?, Well, yeah. Just to clarify, we did win those contracts. We just haven't received any task orders., Right., Yeah. Unfortunately, we do not. You have as much visibility as we do at this point. We tried to gain some of that yesterday in preparation for the release, but we were not successful. So we were hopeful that the , So when we look at the global market and zeroed in on the U.S. market, we see a need for a – maintenance hangars that are capable of managing these new generation aircraft where the tails are a little bit higher and the wings are a little bit longer, and there aren't many facilities in North America capable of handling these aircraft., The State of Illinois was very helpful in allocating funds to build a state-of-the-art facility that would accommodate these new generation aircraft. And we were able to – they put together a very attractive package for us. And we'll probably start, commence building in about six months. We'll probably take 18 months from there. So by that stage, some of these aircraft, the 777X and the 787 will be getting to the point where they'll be entering the maintenance cycle and we should be in a good position to capture some of that work, and the facility will go a long way toward helping that. In addition to the maintenance facilities that they are building, they are also building a mechanics training facility next door. So we're hopeful that they'll be graduating somewhere between 100 and 150 mechanics a year that would provide us with a wealth of trained folks to work on these aircraft., Right., I gave the state Illinois credit, not really thought of it as a business friendly environment. In this case, I think they thought this through very intelligently in terms of kind of combining the training with the facilities, with selecting what they consider to be the best MRO provider in North America, and going ahead and pulling the trigger and putting the capital behind this idea., Yeah. So we're touching customers that we haven't touched in the past. So clearly we're – in addition to providing them the contracted services that they've already agreed to with the predecessor entity we are seeing opportunities to provide other AAR products and services to these customers. So work fairly optimistic that we can get a fair share of business from that market, see some growth, take some of the activities deeper into the Middle East, where you are seeing growth particularly in new generation aircraft without the infrastructure, let's say. And then the Africa market we're looking on that fairly positively as well. So we have a fair level of dialogue in all three markets and are relatively encouraged by – with near-term, mid-term and longer-term opportunities., Okay. Thank you., Hi, Larry. So, yeah the consumable program is still ramping. We are working aggressively to setup a new distribution center in Indianapolis to support that program. It'll probably take us a few more months, I would say, to get the full ramp. The Unison transaction is going as we had anticipated in accordance with our schedule. And then, on EU we're continuing to ramp that program, and we see additional opportunities to grow that product line. It's been – we had a tremendous amount of success in this piece of our business. We are digesting the volumes, but we see significant new opportunities here., Larry, let me add also that the..., ...the investment that we've made in the Brussels operations is leading to deal flow coming out of European customers and Middle East customers that we've not seen before. So the team is aggressively pursuing that market in a way that we didn't really have the capability or visibility in the past., Yeah, now – go ahead., So these assumptions are based on our contract positions in Afghanistan as well as previously announced contract positions both in Afghanistan for NATO, but also incremental positions in Africa that we've already been awarded, Larry. Of the 28, four are what I would call sort of new business, right. The rest are already awarded positions that we're expecting the contracts to get turned on., Larry, let me just say that by the end of the year that we will have these – our intention is to have these problems solved., So we're looking at the directionally in a similar way as we experienced the last couple of years, but we do anticipate some investment in the supply chain business, which might not allow us to hit quite the same level as we had this year., But we expect it to be strong., Yep., Well, yeah. I think we see potential for upside in the supply chain. We've been putting pressure on the supply chain group to grow its earnings at a faster clip than they've submitted, let's say, and the deal flow seems to be pretty robust. We are not calculating in any significant deals in that number. So if we do have a deal or two which – and they are out there -- that would have a positive impact on our results., Yep., Sure., Yeah. No, Kevin that's an accurate read. I mean I think really you've got – we have both a sales and a margin mix sift going on a little bit. And so as airlift comes down, obviously that puts some downward pressure, and as the supply chain businesses sort of kick-in, they have to kind of continue to produce volume to get the margins kind of back up, so that's kind of what's happening there., Yeah. So, we have four NATO positions that we have been awarded. We're just waiting for the go ahead, and I think a part of that is waiting on the services agreement to be signed between the countries. In terms of the baked into the plans for sales, I think we have a few, but not the full complement of aircraft that are for sale., Yeah. Just hang on a sec here., I , Want to get back to him?, I've got so many pages in front of me. So, our billable hours over the last 12 months, we sold over 5 million hours – 5.035 million hours of work sold, right. That's a production efficiency of 107%; worked on 1,082 aircrafts., Fourth quarter we sold 1.218 million., The production efficiency, just so you know, is 111%, so it was good., Hey, Alex., Yeah. Alex, this is Tim. So yeah, we see – the summer is actually the toughest month in the hangars. All of the operators want to have their fleet deployed as much as they possibly can. But we see really the – we see the aircraft starting to come back into the hangars kind of mid-second quarter and then ramping up to the balance of the fiscal year., Also, in the September-October timeframe, we have access to an additional hangar in Lake Charles, we have some good customer interest in that. So that also contributes to our optimism for the second-half of the fiscal year. We are training our workforce now in anticipation of some of the work that we have scheduled for Lake Charles and – so we're optimistic that it's going to turn into a successful operation., Yeah. So the M&A pipeline is fairly robust for us at this stage. We do feel pretty good about our ratios and financial position today. So we may be looking for ways to strengthen our supply chain business during the upcoming period., We do., Well, , Yes., Thank you. Thanks for the questions., I would say fairly consistent with historical pricing. It's steady and it's been pretty decent for us. We are seeing our returns improve in that business and we anticipate our returns will continue to improve in that business. The market is fairly bullish. It's a fairly positive market environment for that business today., I think we've done some smart things in positioning the company in a more international way., Yeah. Larry, it's Tim. Yes, it is. That would be our main wide-body operation, we have a couple of aircraft in there now. But we do expect Lake Charles will be busy as we get into the second half of the fiscal year., We do., We do. But we also do wide-body in other places in our network. But..., But Lake Charles will be well suited for., We went back, Larry, and – well, we actually went back more than five years. If you look back over the last five years, we feel that that's a comfortable rate that we sort of have achieved year-on-year. And then when you look specifically at what we're looking at for next year, it's going to triangulate in., Well, I think history as any indicator, we think that's a good number., First of all, I think that's too early to tell. So, the oil prices have dropped precipitously here in the last 90 days or so. So, I'm not so certain that we have a trend yet. Clearly, our customers are benefiting from this low oil price rate, but I'm not certain at this point that it caused them to adjust their long-term fleet planning., Now, that said, our business, as you can see, our business supporting the world's fleet is growing quite steadily and at very attractive rates, keeping in mind that all these growth rates are organic. So, I believe we're in a good position, expanding our business, I think, nicely. Suite of products that we offer in the supply chain arena in particular are very appealing, and I believe the spread we have now in terms of the capability in North America for air-freight maintenance is also quite strong. So, yeah, I think that the economic environment is more friendly today than it's been in a while for the airlines., And as that continues, whether they take on newer aircraft or not, I believe we're well positioned., Yeah. Unison has been in place for a period of time, and it's, I think, fairly steady., And the Eaton programs are in their launch phase and still in a build-up phase. We're probably more of a net investor at this point in time than a net beneficiary. But I would anticipate that as the other distributors work through their inventories that we'll be in a good position to start seeing ramp in sales., Yeah. I think as we sit here today, we don't see anything different from what we saw at that point, when we adjusted earlier in the year., Yeah. Thank you., Well, I think everything that we have in our portfolio today is core. So I mean we're viewing all our businesses as core. I think we're looking at how do we go ahead and maximize our investments. And so, I think we're performing normal functions in that regard and we will continue to do so. So, I don't see any change in that regard., Yeah. I don't believe we've seen much change in those businesses. So, it's a little bit frustrating from our side. But as I indicated, by the end of the year, we should be in a position to talk more specifically., Yes., I think 100%., Yeah. Yeah., Well, first of all, I view the reduction in oil prices right now as a positive. I would be hopeful that the price level will settle. If it settles in a range where we are today, I believe that's very positive for our industry and for ourselves. It's a little bit difficult knowing – it's a little bit difficult to pinpoint where oil prices may fall. But nevertheless, I believe that the state of the airline industry when oil prices were in the $100 range, were very positive. And I think with the price of the barrel being in the $50 – $55 to $60 range, it's even that much more positive., So, I look at the industry – I look at the U.S. commercial airline industry as probably being the healthiest it's been since I've been in the industry, and it's helping us think through our strategy as we look at the – how well they're doing and what their prospects look like. So, I hope I'm answering your question., In terms of values on inventory, we're getting – we're able to make good investments. We've made some solid investments this quarter, while we're still generating cash from ops and free cash. So, I believe that we have our tentacles out in the worldwide market, and I think we're in a good position of benefit as the fleets grow and as fleets change., So, I think oil is just – the price of oil I think is contributing to what was already a fairly conducive environment for the things we do., Hey, Kevin., Yeah. So – Hey, Kevin. It's John Fortson. So, we did have two aircrafts that were de-scoped that were not anticipated. So, we technically finished the quarter at 17, but we've actually picked up two aircrafts since quarter end, so we're back to 19., And in different geographies – sorry?, No, it's in a different geography., But, yeah, I mean, look, we're tracking these obviously very, very carefully. The two that came out were not expected, but we've actually had two incremental wins. So..., Yeah. So we're sitting at 16 right now. We have had some progress. We haven't actually sold any aircraft. But we think we're getting closer on a couple, and we feel like we'll get some out the door by – in this quarter., Yes. This is Tim, Kevin. Yes. We're working off a few contracts that we have now, but we are taking steps to broaden our customer base of engineering services. We have a couple of programs going on in Asia and a few programs in North America. But as you know, they're very lumpy. And the programs that we have today are smaller than the ones that we were working on a year ago. So, we are investing in some resources now to be – have more exposure to some of the major reconfiguration – interior reconfiguration programs that are going on., We're seeing some opportunity out of our Lake Charles facility, where we can do the touch labor. So, hopefully, by combining our touch labor capability as well as our engineering services capability both in North America and in Asia, we're hoping that we're going to be able to capture some more business there. But, for the balance of the fiscal year, what we see now is roughly in line with what we had in the first half of the fiscal year., Well, it definitely has impact at the cargo system and spares level. But we do have deliveries in the second half of the fiscal year more so than in the first half of the fiscal year. But the decline in production will, over time, obviously have an impact, and then also, on spares. One of the variable though is the split, the mix between passenger and freighter..., ...and that we, in time, remains to be seen., Both. At the right time, right. In this quarter, we've reduced some debt and we brought in some shares. So, I think we'll continue to look at the best utilization for our cash spent., Yeah. I believe that the shares are undervalued and represent a wonderful investment opportunity., Okay. Thank you."
1004,2015.0,Q&A,a,"No, I think definitely. I think if I look at this in kind of three phases, Phase 1 is more or less where we're at today. Phase 2 is kind of some of this action that John has talked about. And then Phase 3 will be a newer company, a cleaner balance sheet going out into the future. So going out to the future means how do we go ahead and take our industry-leading position here in this service sector and create something even more special? We should have a lot of balance sheet flexibility to do that., So, yes, Larry, the Telair business is a great business., So we, and TransDigm bought great businesses., So I think that's a part of the equation, and they paid us I think accordingly. I think they paid us a fair price. I think it's a good price for us and a good price for them., In terms of the Precision Systems business, that's been a drag., And I think when you factor into the impacts of that transaction, on balance that's how we improve our return on capital and other important metrics. So I think you have to look at this on a – kind of a consolidated basis. The good news is we've reached an agreement to sell the businesses at a fair price., And we'll be taking action on the underperforming assets, which is something we communicated earlier in the fiscal year., Yes. I think that's a good way to look at it., Yep., Mix between what and what?, In terms of revenue proportionality, Tyler, is that what you're asking?, Yes – you want to go ahead?, Go ahead., Yes. I mean, look, when you sort of look in the aggregate of the reorg, you're talking about a $1.2 billion top-line business, a $1.3 billion top-line business in the Aviation Services segment, right? And then, the balance, the remainder in the Mobility and Airlift., No, but he's asking for commercial versus that. Why don't you let us get back to you on that? We'll get back to you on that., Yes., So the businesses have improved, but they continue to be a drag. So we've had a fair amount of traction, positive traction, in the components piece, but we've kind of continued to be underperforming our metals piece. So, on balance, when you bring them together, they're a drag on earnings., Yes. Between the two sort of categories of Precision Systems, it's about a $62 million, $63 million revenue business., We don't really go that deep into analysis. I think maybe – we're only going to own the business for another 30 to 60 days, so I don't think there's any reason for us to pass that on., Good morning., Yes. I think there might be some of that, one-time in nature, but we're not in a position today to really discuss that, only because we haven't really made up our minds what we're going to do in that regard., We're doing an analysis on make-wholes versus – and when to go ahead and flip the switch, and we don't have that answer yet., Wait. Say it one more time, please., Well, the Telair businesses generate nice cash returns, and the Precision businesses were a cash drain. So on balance, I think we generated more cash than not, but the rest of our businesses should do very well., Airlift and within the supply chain., Yes., Yes., No, not safe to say., Right., Yes, the opportunity pull-in that we're facing in Airlift is quite sizeable., Yes., Yes. So, we have the high-yield bonds, which are not callable yet, but they do have a make-whole feature. And we're kind of exploring timing on the retirement of those bonds. We're not in a position today to discuss that, because we're not sure., Yes. We are playing different scenarios and looking at different timing scenarios, okay., Thank you., I would say we're relatively early, only because most of our energy has been put on this transaction, but we do have a process in place. And hopefully, maybe as early as the end of this quarter, we'll have something to talk about., So I think – look at the cash from three different – stools, if you will, three legs. One is – first leg is the debt leg; second leg is the return capital to shareholder leg, and those are kind of intertwined, if you will. And the third leg would be acquisitions. My first priority, quite frankly, is that return to shareholders/deal with the debt. So that's my – the balance between those two is our first priority; acquisitions would be our next priority. So when I think of phases, as I indicated, I think of this in three phases. So Phase 1 we've announced. Phase 2 is kind of doing the debt, return to shareholder phase. And Phase 3 is clearing the path for growth, acquisitions, et cetera., Well, we're always looking, and people are always reaching out to us. We do have a few different things that we're exploring, but I would – at this stage, I wouldn't say that that opportunity pool is as brisk, let's say, as our organic business opportunity pool., Thank you., Good morning, Tom., So we feel good about our MRO position here in North America. We would like to see if there are ways to strengthen our MRO footprint outside of North America. So I think that's probably a way to look at it. The dynamics outside North America will be different, obviously. We have looked at a few different situations already and determined that it was not in our best interest to proceed, but we will continue to look for opportunities in the MRO universe. We're the third-largest MRO provider today in the world, and the largest in North America, so we'll see if there's ways to intelligently parlay that position into a more meaningful piece of our business., So we continue to invest in this area. It still is of critical importance to the businesses. We have recently announced a teaming with state of Illinois and Rockford, Illinois, for a facility as well as for a training ground for next-generation mechanics, let's say, so this is still, I would say, an ongoing challenge here in the United States., Thank you, sir., We can hear you., We can, Rob., John Fortson, would you answer that, please?, Sure. You know, Robert, we are not giving guidance for the rest of the fiscal year. Obviously, we have a business plan out there, and we expect to see continued growth in our flying positions. You can extrapolate from the numbers that we've given you. It's not too hard to envision that we could be in sort of mid to high 20 aircraft positions if some things go according to plan, but obviously there's execution risk in Afghanistan as well., So we feel good about where the fleet sits today. I do think from a mix perspective some of the contracts that we have today, we lost a couple of the very profitable S92s and so that's impacting the mix unfavorably from a margin perspective, but I think that as the fleet gets back to a more normalized level in the back part of the year you're going to see those margins improve., Right., Well, look, I think that's right. I think you'll see some mix improve. I think we've got some operational opportunities to improve the efficiency of our fleet in different geographies..., And then obviously as other contracts come on board that we expect to see that will help it as well., Well, I mean, we've been through a fairly significant transformation at the company. So my preference is to let the dust settle. I think as we progress throughout the year, I think we'll be in a better position to offer up guidance. So I think we indicated back in March that we were going to take a pause from guidance between now and through the second quarter of this fiscal year and I'd like to stick with that at this point..., So I think we'll have a lot more visibility come the second half of the year. We have to get all of our costs to flow through. We've had a lot of one-time exceptional costs, and we want to get our handle on those. And then we do have, as I indicated, a fairly – a robust pipeline inside of the Airlift business, and we want to see how that flushes out as well., Great., Hey., Yeah, so I mean, I have a little bit of an advantage over others in that I've seen this movie for the last 37 years..., So my sense is that we've had a little bit of a lull. I've seen these before. In talking with some customers and talking with our people, I get a sense that things – well, and I already see in the month of September that we are seeing some improvement. Now, I'm not excited yet, but I do believe that we will see strengthening throughout the balance of the year. And that the first quarter was a little rough, but my sense is air miles haven't really diminished much. And what you would say, the fleet age really hasn't changed a lot. And I think similar to what you see with Southwest with taking 737-700s and putting them to work. I think my sense is that's more the norm than something out of the norm. So my view is that, yeah, we'll see strengthening as the year progresses., Yes. Yes, I am., Well, I believe Lake Charles itself, if I were to isolate Lake Charles, it still has certain risks associated with it because we're still trying to get a normalized pattern going there. We came through the quarter I think in good shape, and we have some optimism, but I'd like to hold back – reserve my comment on that until I see another quarter or two under our – have another quarter or two under our belt., So in general though, if I can comment on MRO in general..., I feel very good about our prospects and we're having good interaction with our customers. We're getting a sense that there's a fair amount of demand that's pent up, and we expect good solid results through the balance of the fiscal year from our MRO activities., Well, not as much as it is on the heavy maintenance side. However, we do see a better, let's say, Q2 over Q1, but still not satisfied with the level of inputs and still not achieving the same levels we've had in the past. So I'd like to reserve my comments there as well., Yeah. Some of that occurred in SG&A and some of that occurred in direct expense..., And the biggest single item that would be unusual in the SG&A would be some of the legal costs that we've incurred., Yes. Yeah. We're getting – that's in preparation in the event that we win that contract. That's correct., Yep., Hi Kevin., Tim Romenesko, you want to take that question?, Sure. Yeah, so we are expecting to have startup costs on the Falklands program in Q2 and Q3 and it'll be $3 million to $4 million. It's people costs. It's training costs. It's positioning costs. And so we think that that will have an impact between Q2 and Q3 and then Q4 when the program starts obviously those costs go away. And then we flip around into profitability. So that's the biggest startup costs that we're seeing in front of us for the balance of the fiscal year., Yes. Yes. No, cumulative..., Spread over the two quarters., John Holmes, you want to answer that question?, Sure, sure. Outside of Trading, the rest of Aviation Services actually came in at or above expectations. Trading was the single area that was below. And there really was not one single product or category that was soft. We felt it in multiple ways across the business, both in the engine parts and air frame parts side. The only thing I would say is that in certain areas we saw a weak demand, and we had supply. And in other areas, we saw a strong demand, but were unable to get our hands on the material to fill that demand. So we had a couple of different dynamics going there., That's our contract wins that are already announced. So building off of programs that have already been won, and those investments are in line with the plan., I'll take that one, and we will watch that closely. We have about $95 million left on our authorization, and we will look at that closely., Yeah, that's right. That's right., Well, we'd like to get it down. We've historically operated, call it, in the sort of 9.5% range and anything north of that we're sort of not happy with. But I think we want to be clear, I mean, some of these legal expenses we expect to continue for a while., Couple of quarters, I would think., Well, I would expect that through the balance of the year we will continue to see improving results and..., Yeah., Right., In the back part of the year, Robert. Right., Not to our expectations..., That's correct..., We expect to be positive in Q2., Yes., We expect to do better., Well, I think you're going to see an improvement, a steady improvement in Q2. And then, hopefully, you see more meaningful improvements in Q3 and Q4., And what I was really referring to, Rob, is more from a historical perspective. I think we can get into historical return levels by Q3., Yes. Correct., Yeah. And – yeah, correct., So we're seeing – just so everyone is clear, we're seeing strength in our businesses in the commercial markets. We see opportunities in the Airlift market. We have softness in the defense spending for our Mobility businesses. That would be, I would say, a general overview of our businesses. And we would expect that the Supply Chain business will continue to improve, as will the MRO businesses. And we see a little bit of choppiness still in the Airlift business. We'll feel better about that once we have the Falklands contract operating versus spending money to get ready for it to operate., I think that's a good way to look at it., Yeah, we've predicted close to bottom before and..., We've been wrong..., 
            , But maybe, Tim Romenesko, maybe you can give a little bit more color on that, if you don't mind?, David's right. We've predicted the bottom before, and we've been wrong. We are seeing a little bit of year-end activity around a couple of product lines, but other product lines are pretty quiet. So I think David's characterization is right on., Not that high., John Holmes?, Yeah. Sure. No, that is new work. That's a new contract. The scope of that is I would characterize it as a modest start, but there's an opportunity to add on the rest of the Airinmar services with SkyWest, ExpressJet. So, no, that is a new win for that business., Good morning., Yeah. Rob, what we'd like to do is we'd like to let the year kick in, let's start the year. We have a fair amount of variability in our airlift business. And as I've indicated, we've won some contracts and we do have some contracts we believe we're going to win. So, there's a little bit of – far enough range at this stage that I think we prefer not to put out some numbers at this point., Well, the largest contract is the Falkland contract, which is $339 million, and that's over a 12-year period., And then the balance of the contracts are three years, and one contract is a five-year., Hey, Rob. It's John. Yeah. So when we talk, we talk in terms of contracted revenue generating positions. We finished the year with 19 positions. , Yeah. And so, we – based on current deal flow, based on current contracts, we're looking at 32 at the end of the year., Yeah. So, we have historically had very strong margins in the Expeditionary segments. So that's going to be volume paced. So as the volume picks up, we'll start seeing margin throughput from that business. So right now in both businesses, in Expeditionary, you're kind of at the bottom point of the historical result cycle, if you will., In terms of the MRO and supply chain, I would anticipate that we'll see better margins throughout the year. So, the supply chain margins will improve as volumes grow, as will the MROs. And the MRO, the move out of Hot Springs saves us about $1.5 million a year in – or add $1.5 million a year to the margin, the gross margin for that section of our business., Yep., Good morning. Sure., Yeah. Well, the one-time charge from that is what, a $1 million?, $1 million., $1 million from the shutdown of Hot Springs. I believe that the – for the most part, I can't think of any other charges that we see coming at us. We will be selling some airlift aircrafts. The net effect though of the sale of the aircrafts is about, say, somewhere between $18 million and $22 million of sales. We'll probably be neutral. We wouldn't expect losses. If anything, we might have slight gains from those sales. So we don't expect any other noise other than John referred to the tail to the Darwin – or I'm sorry for the Telair transaction of up to $35 million, and that would be a positive impact., And that $18 million to $22 million, Kevin, includes inventory that's associated with some of those aircraft down there , Yeah. So, Kevin, this is Tim Romenesko. So, we really see the revenue ramp later in the fiscal year when the larger programs kick in. In the early part of the fiscal year, we'll be incurring costs associated with the start-up of the Falklands program and that includes taking on the new aircraft. It includes the pilot training, building up the maintenance capability. So, those costs are fairly significant and will kind of mute some of the positive impact of the new aircraft that we're bringing onboard., But once we get into – once we get the Falklands contract ramping and we get the cumulative effect of the other aircraft coming on, we'll be – that business will be generating decent returns and will be back to not exactly where it was before but approaching its peak performance., Sure. This is John Holmes, responsible for the Aviation Services Group. But at Lake Charles, we're still on a hiring phase there. We went through quite a ramp-up period in FY 2015. We expect to get to at least a breakeven operation there in FY 2016. We've got some significant programs starting with Delta Air Lines that will be ramping up in the fall. And so, we're looking forward to the positive impact there out of Lake Charles., And Hot Springs, the consolidation actually will be done by the end of this month. And we'll have exited – so, the main customer that was in Rockford was – Air Wisconsin there or transitioning to Oklahoma City, and then by the end of August we'll have exited the operations in Hot Springs., Can you repeat – can you just repeat that, please? We weren't – able to hear you., Yeah. Well, so we don't comment on the individual necessarily. But suffice to say, the growth in supply chain was strong, was very strong., Yeah. The new programs and you may recall, I would say about a year ago, we entered into an agreement with Eaton. And we started taking delivery of the inventory for Eaton and we started making sales from the – and supporting the Eaton product during this period. And program activity was strong. And across the board, we have strengthened the supply chain businesses as we did in the MRO business., A 17% organic growth in this period, if you check around the horns, there are few companies growing at that rate in our industry., Yeah. I mean, look, I think our SG&A is going to revert into the sort of 9% to 10% range where – it should do a little bit better than we have historically. But I think for modeling, I would sort of assume that., Thanks, , Well, , Yeah, we have a three-year plan that gets us up to our 10% objective., Right. Right. But it's real and we have to win some business and – yeah, but we feel we can get there., By the way, we've lowered our corporate expense by $8.2 million in the quarter. So, going forward, our corporate expense will be, as I said, lowered by $8.2 million., Yeah. Yeah., Yeah. Thanks., Good morning., Yeah, I mean, the way to think about the MRO is probably the hours of maintenance and the cumulative man hours and that number has been a little bit down. And give or take, it's around the 5 million level. And so, it's one of the reasons why we took the action we did with Hot Springs to reduce some of our footprint..., ...and get more productivity out of our remaining footprint. So – and we're also trying to find the lowest cost solution. One of the reasons why we moved into Lake Charles was , Just where the aircraft are in the repair cycle, as well as the capacity in North America., Not really. I think the average age – the fleet age, I think, has been – again, using my historical knowledge, I don't think there's been more than a one-year average age variation over the last 25 years., But I mean, if the average age is – and don't quote me exactly, but if it's 12.9 years or 13.2 years or 12.7 years, it really doesn't make – it really doesn't play a factor here., We haven't really seen much of that., Well, we're looking at double-digit sales growth..., And we're looking at double-digit earnings growth from those businesses., No, we're looking for improvement in MRO as well. So, we're looking for improvement or growth, I should say, in both., MRO is not earning at peak levels right now. So, we have had higher earning levels at MRO than we are currently experiencing., 70%., Yep., Sure., Yeah, so, we are – we have exited certain product lines that we've viewed nonproductive. And we are seeing an uptick in the cycle. We expect that to kick in more so as the fiscal year moves forward. So, think of it as a 10-year cycle. So if you look at deliveries out of factories, 10 years back, they were starting to pick up in the 2005 time period. And so we should start seeing 2005, 2006, we should start seeing improvement in that operation., No. I think it's all kind of connected. My sense is that there are clearly operational needs that the customer has, customer being USTRANSCOM for the most part. So, it's just that there are delays in funding and appropriations, I believe that have had some impact. So, yeah, I mean, it's kind of – I don't think anything specific to AAR that you won't be seeing in other government contracting environments., Yeah., How are you doing, Lee?, Yeah. I mean we're not necessarily disclosing that at this moment, but it's not insignificant. It's a little bit – it'll be higher in Q3 than it was in Q2. But then we'll start – obviously as we start getting revenues in Q4, it turns from being a drag to being a contributor., Well, I think we've made a series of – we've had a series of contract wins. I believe our business model is appealing to a broad range of customers, commercially and – commercial markets and defense customers. And, yeah, I think our team is doing a nice job, good leadership coming out of John Holmes' office, and his team surrounding him is executing and doing a good job., I don't really – I wouldn't have an answer for that that would be quantitative in the nature. My sense is that fleets are – that the airlines are adding capacity and more capacity is good for our business., I think our inventory is in good position. We were a little bit surprised Q1, in terms of the softness. I believe our inventories probably ballooned a little bit in Q1 and I think they're probably more in line with results coming out of Q2. So, we have a great position in this market not just here in the United States, but worldwide. And we had nice improvement in Q2 over Q1, notwithstanding the fact that on a year-over-year basis we were down. So, a great team in place. And again, I believe that that market – our performance will be fine., Let me turn it over to Tim Romenesko., Yeah. So, we ended the quarter with 22 positions, but then on December 1, three positions – three contract positions were completed. We – those we expect to be put out for a re-bid here in the next few months, and we got a chance at least to get those back. There are a few other larger RFPs that we think are going to be coming, we've heard are going to be coming, but we haven't seen them yet, and these are the RFPs that we've been talking about for a few quarters here. So, as David mentioned in his comments, they have been slow to hit the market and it's impacted our results and our outlook., We're looking – the third quarter, we're expecting to be lighter than the second quarter, due to the three positions coming out as well as the increases in cost that David referred to related to the startup of the Falklands program. So, yes., Well, they already split a year ago from the traditional IML contract. So, that's pretty well – that's generally well known. In terms of our expectation for the current bid, let's say, we're not aware of any – there's been no indication of a desire to split that. So we think we have a good competitive solution set, and we maintain we've submitted our proposal, and we're waiting to hear., I think we're led to believe somewhere in the January-February timeframe., No. I mean, I think so far, all decisions have been – are public in nature and have been favorable towards us., The only confidence I have is accretive. So anything that happens will be accretive. In terms of near or far, out of our – it's relatively out of our control. We are actively engaged in a few situations, but hard to say whether decisions are imminent or not. In terms of – so, we will continue to look at all the different possibilities. Obviously, the balance sheet is in a very strong position. And with some of the uncertainty in the world, we view that as a pretty good position to be in., I'm not sure. I can't – I can't say I have any answer to that. I think if pace picks up so there's more action, then it'll have a favorable impact on our business. But I can't comment because I just don't know if moving people into Helmand Province or other things you referenced will have an impact on our – a meaningful impact on our business., Right., So, yeah I'm not aware of any direct impact. Our relationship with the UAE – they're also actively engaged in the Yemen market – should be favorable too. But I can't think of anything short-term., We're seeing lots of interests and we are seeing solicitations. I'm not – I don't believe they're necessarily related to those items, , I don't see how it can get any more negative., Yeah. Thank you., Hi, Robert., Yeah. I think the business has been a little slower to recover. Keep in mind now, I believe part of those 23 were also the two that we have coming online later this year with the placement of two aircraft with the British Ministry of Defense against a 10-year contract. So I think the – correct though, it has been a little slower to recover than we had hoped. We have had a series of protests around certain wins that we've had, and we've had a couple of programs that have been a little longer to materialize, but again, Bob, I would say that we feel good about the business. It's unfortunate that we have such a good year last year, I guess, and the comparison's a little bit difficult, but you will see improved results coming out of that business., Yeah. So the business has historically been extremely cash flow positive. So it's generated a fair amount of cash for the company. At current, it's relatively flat from a cash flow standpoint. We will generate cash with the sale of the assets that'll be in the $11 million to $12 million range, and we do anticipate that we will probably this quarter be a net investor, but the business should be generating positive cash out into 2016., Yeah, call it 50-50., It's a little bit more airlift than it is mobility, but approximately, let's call it 50-50., Well, so there's a lot of different ways looking at these businesses. If we look at them snapshot wise, we're getting more cash coming out of mobility. If we look at it from a, let's call it a five-year horizon, they've both been strong profit contributors to the company. Airlift at its peak would have contributed far more cash than with mobility, but mobility at peak also contributed a fair amount of cash., Yeah. They're both by the way, I should add, they both are leadership positions in their respective markets. The both markets, I would say, are going through airlift a little bit more of a transition because of the heavy dependence we had on the Afghanistan market, but both businesses are leaders in their respective markets., Yep., A little drop in mobility, but mostly coming out of airlift., Yeah. less It's flying hours and what we had, as you recall Larry, we had the F-92s..., ...in prior periods. The F-92s were huge contributors, because we billed more for them and they flew more. The F-92s are now parked looking for a new home., I would say you'll have periods where it'll be a little bit stronger and periods where it'll be a little bit weaker. So I think it's kind of bouncing around. It still has a nice profitability, it's still a profitable business, but I would say it's kind of giving us good return on capital., But it's just bouncing around., Yeah. It's definitely in the mix. So it's really just a – we're just trying to get our thoughts together and figure out the best approach., Yep., I would expect the business overall to be cash flow positive in Q4., I think we have certain challenges around airlift as we position assets. So every time we win a contract, we have to put some investment, minor investment relatively so, but still investment in the assets and a push-off start date on the assets as well. So I think Q4 for airlift because of the sale of the assets we have pending, probably from all ends, I would expect it to be cash flow positive. From an operating vantage point, it may not be., There's 12 available for sale right now, right. So we last reported to you guys the number was 16, we had talked about potentially taking it up to 18, but we've actually returned some S-61s to the active fleet for use in future missions, so we're sitting at 12 today., I think it's kind of a mix year of the number of flying positions plus the number of hours they're flying, plus the type of assets that they are. So I think at the point we're at right now, we're kind of at that point, if we're talking about that breakeven point., So. Yeah I think it's a mix of all of the above., I believe so, yes. I believe that you may have – there was some very favorable pricing, let's say, at a stage in the Afghanistan build-up, that pricing is probably not available today, but I would say that we have set pricing opportunities that are equal to profit opportunities that we're looking at, yes., We're still working it hard. I mean we had a tough quarter in late trails. We had a lot of build-up costs in late trials during the period. Notwithstanding those we still add earnings growth from the businesses, we would expect that we will gain more traction, positive traction I should say, this quarter than last and we feel we're out there trying to win more wide-body business., Yeah. And they're performing to our expectations., Yeah., Sure., Yeah. I think for the time being we're seeing – I think, we're benefiting from scale. So our cost structure has stayed relatively flat and we've had slight increase in the costs supporting those businesses but we've had nice progress in volume improvement. So we're getting a little bit of scale that's working in our favor. But we also – we're seeing improvement in our landing gear business for instance. So we're getting more volume coming through that shop. Our component shops are doing better. So I think, across the board, you're seeing improvements in operating. Now, we did have a ding in Lake Charles. Lake Charles was a negative contributor during the period, which is not unusual this early in the buildup phase of one of our MROs., Yes. It's a bit slower than we expected and it's not as steep as we had hoped, but it is recovering., Yeah. So we're looking at -- the supply chain business has been exceptionally strong. We are playing around with a few different international activities. You may recall last year, we acquired the inventory from Sabena technics. That turned out to be a very good move for the company, very positive move. So we're looking at other opportunities along those lines, and the pipeline is pretty good., Yeah. So we've put out a – I don't think it's called the tender, but we put on a offer to buy the redeems or redemption, I guess is the right word, a redemption on these bonds today and that's a 30-day process., Yep., Yes., I mean, there's always the possibility, right? I mean, it's kind of the nature of our business is we're always looking at opportunity. So in terms of close, it's hard for me to – your definition of close to the end and mine might be different, but we have stuff in the pipeline. Let me put it that way., It's not for lack of effort. We have to find the right situation. I mean MRO has its kind of subtleties like every business does, but going international is not as easy as it sounds because you're dealing with different cultures and different work habits and things of that nature. And our view is that, yes, we are interested in international MRO. We have gone down numerous paths with different local potential partners, none of which have materialized, but we are still out there kind of starting up the hornet's nest to try to find the right opportunity., Yeah. That's correct, but that's not – we won't be operating that facility. They're just buying our expertise on setting up the facility., No., No. No. That's the – UAE government will be the operator. They procured certain capability from us that we're providing them., Well, there are rules and there are laws and we will buy every one of them. So it depends on the structure and right now we're in the blackout., Yes, because we tend to allow investors 24 hours or so to absorb the information. So yeah – so we will abide by every law there is., I think, tomorrow., Okay. All right. Thank you. Okay."
1004,2016.0,Q&A,a,"Hi, Larry., Well, MRO had, as I think we signaled in , We're seeing many opportunities. John Holmes is not with us here today in Chicago because he's out busy with customers, trying to drum up some additional business, and actually meeting with a customer in our New York facility today. So yeah, we're expecting, we're hopeful that we can announce a contract after October 1 that we're working on for quite some time, that's a pretty good size. And I would say, around the horn, the supply chain businesses are strong, Aviation, the MRO has gone through a typical cyclical experience and strengthening, and we're feeling pretty good about where we are today., Yeah., Yeah. We've been diminishing our footprint there. We're keeping it open for now for some light paint type work. As we've discussed before, the State of Illinois has constructed facility for us in Rockford, that we're kind of pivoting towards, and hopefully we'll be generating some revenue and income coming out of that facility in the not too distant future. We'll keep you up to speed on that., Yes. Airlift has improved a little bit., Well, our thoughts are that, we're seeing signs of life in both businesses. So we are seeing the , Well, we hold up for making comments on the contracts, it's in the protest period., And I think, we'll talk about it once it emerges out of protest., Yeah. Thank you., Sure. Thanks., Yeah. So we've expanded our program selling capability. And I think, what you're seeing here in some of these announcements is a reflection of their efforts, and we have a team of folks who joined us last year, and they're a wonderful team. They complement our organization in a very positive way. And we're very hopeful that we'll continue to benefit from their efforts. Also, first quarter as always is little softer for us because of MRO sales. But we anticipate, our goal is always to be below 10%, and our goal is to get down to that level before the fiscal year is out., Yeah. No, no, no, before we had manufacturing group of businesses, and that's where it was. And when we sold off the businesses, and we kind of restructured the manufacturing, we basically just stopped and looked to exit both the composites business and the metals business. We ultimately wind down the metals business, but the composites business, which we're trying to sell, we weren't able to get prices that we're happy with. So we thought it was best from the customers' perspective, for our people, et cetera, to go ahead and try to revitalize the business, and we've had some success in that regard. So the business, based on how we see the markets unfolding, the leadership team at Mobility is a very capable leadership team, as you know. And they were eager to take on some added responsibility, and they now have this operations part of their business., We've had success in the past, and continue to have success serving some of the regional manufacturers. We've had some success on interiors for certain specialized aircraft. That business continues to be strong. So I mean, we're looking at opportunities to support the Boeings of the world, and the folks who support Boeing, as well as some of the regional carriers that are out there as well. So we're kind of like a niche like business. We have some activity in the flat panel world. I don't know, Tim, is there anything else to add?, No, that's pretty good. We're supporting some of the helicopter manufacturers. That piece of the business has been doing pretty well., It's both, but it's mostly commercial., Yeah. I think the engineering business has had a couple of wins, we had one , Thanks, , Yes. The first priority is to use our capital to grow our business, strengthen our franchise, and improve the depth of products that we offer to our customers. So that would be our first priority. Short of being able to increase the business in that fashion we – and let me make that into part A and part B; part A of that is external deals, let's say, acquisition; part B is funding existing capability, and the quarter just ended, for instance, we spent a fair amount of money funding inventory programs for our strategic customers. Then nextly, I'd say share repurchase would be next, and across the board, every quarter we review our dividend, our dividend policy, and that's always discussed as well., We're seeing deals that are interesting. We're not seeing anything that is compelling necessarily, but we are seeing stuff out there. There is a fair amount of stuff that we're looking at. As you know, we're being very selective and disciplined. But I would say, the deal flow on the acquisition side is light to moderate, in a general sense., Yes, , So we have a contract. The contract is under a protest. Under the protest, we're issued a stay order by the customer or a stop order. So we are not working, we are no longer working on the contract, but we do have a contract. In terms of the profitability or impact on company's results, we prefer not to discuss that at this stage., Well, I prefer not to discuss it. I think it's a contract that – it's a program that we have a high level of confidence that – or what we know that we can deliver in a way that's superior to, and that the customer is accustomed to. And that's all I would say., I think the State Department put up a release, which indicated the potential value up to $10 billion., Okay. Thank you., Hi, Kevin., So we communicated that target reduction, Kevin, last year, and that was all largely realized sometime in the first quarter of this fiscal year. I think largely we've completed all those activities. There is always perhaps some room. But as I indicated, Kevin, we're pretty comfortable with the cost structure, not just at corporate, but across the company. It's not that we don't analyze it and continue to focus on it. But that ratio that we tend to talk about as a percent of sales, we think it's mostly going to improve as we go forward from increasing sales., Let me ask Tim to answer that question, Kevin., Hey, Kevin. So we're looking for improved margins off of the fiscal 2016 base. You probably saw today that we were awarded a couple of new contract positions in Afghanistan for S-61 helicopters. We expect those to start contributing to our results late in this quarter and really have a full effect in the second quarter. So between that, the , So we're at 21 today. We picked up the two additional in Afghanistan, and we ended the third quarter at 19., So, Kevin, this is David once again. I don't believe that the pressures been around competition as much as the pressures been around overall market demand. So, this quarter was a fairly – a pretty decent quarter for that business improvement, sequentially and improvement year on year. You're correct in that the levels are not where we may have been historically, and correct that we've been fairly profitable in this business. So, we remain cautiously optimistic that the – as we move along into the new fiscal year, these businesses will perform well and have a positive impact on year-over-year margin result., There may be problems with people getting questions in, because I know there were a couple of people who expressed interest in getting questions, but we don't see their names on your list., I think it would best probably not commenting on that. We don't see that necessarily as a possibility, but probably best not to comment., We're not aware of any impacts on their decision-making process. We're aware of the extensions. But again, I think probably best off not to comment., Yeah., Good., Good., No difference on our business., We want the best people to serve., Obviously, we've sold the Cargo business. It was a very successful transaction., We have successfully wound down the Metals business, and the Composites business is still in our discontinued portfolio., Thanks, Tom., Margin improvement in our core Aviation Service businesses and we've expressed certain disappointments around Airlift. We also are waiting on certain contracts, and we'd be disappointed if our margins don't get closer to the area you indicated., I think better than that., Yes., First off, think of it as two different businesses, one business that's more tied to say recent activities in Afghanistan, one business that's tied to troop preparation, troop movement, et cetera, all over the world to the United States government. So the delineation, the distinction would be between our Mobility business and our Airlift business. In terms of and if you look, the Mobility business has part of AAR since 1981 and has had in the past times of good performance and weaker performance based on the particular cycles surrounding those types of products and services., If you look at the Airlift business, a recent business to the company, to your point, it did very well in the Afghanistan build up. We're looking closely at that business for ways to extract value and we will do the best we can. And if we get to the point where we can no longer extract the right value, we will take other action., I don't think that I would look at it necessarily that way as much as – so we have some very meaningful contracts today. I think you heard earlier in the call, we have 21 aircrafts that are operating. Part of the challenge is the aircraft we have that are not operating. Some of the aircraft we do have up for sale and we do have interested parties in buying those assets. So it may very well be at the asset base gets compressed and also we take advantage of our knowledge if you will in serving helicopters to expand our services beyond just operating these aircrafts., Okay, thank you., Hi, Larry., No. It's pretty much in line with what we thought. I mean, last year was kind of a – so what we communicated, , Yeah. That's the way to look at it, Larry. So we took our action. We have always struggled with profitability there, and we just decided once we were able to come online in Rockford that there was no reason to continue chasing up business the way we had been. So yeah, we feel good about that change from earnings efficiency standpoint., No, no, no. Actually, so let's – just to clarify that, so the State Department awarded us the contract back on September 1. The GAO reviewed and DynCorp properly filed the protest, which was fully expected. The GAO considered their protest and denied the protest, which in essence starts the process between ourselves and the state., Now, at the same time, they have further – DynCorp can now go to the, what you call, the court of claims or something like that, Federal Court of Claims (sic) [U.S. Court of Federal Claims], to pursue their claims., But obviously, Larry, listen, it's an important contract with DynCorp. It's important for us from a standpoint of their solvency from all appearances, and they're going to keep fighting. And they're going to fight until they can, but I think it's been pretty clear that the customers made their selection. The GAO has gone ahead and upheld the customer selection. We feel very confident that our solution set is unique and superior to anything anybody else can offer., We were able to blend in best practices from across our network of things that we do in the company. And I think the State Department saw value, and the GAO basically affirmed that. So DynCorp is going to continue, I believe, down a frivolous path, and we're fully prepared to defend our position and the work we've done and look forward to supporting the state in the way that the state, we believe, they will be very satisfied with their selection when they reflect back a few years down the path., Yeah. So the mobility business has a little bit of momentum. The Airlift business , Yes., Hi, Shannon., Yeah. I would say by the fourth quarter and first quarter you'll start seeing the gains from programs offset the losses from KC10. And then once we start the revenue stream from the INL/A, we'll be way past whatever sales declines we have from the KC10., Yeah. So we're working very hard, December, at this stage, probably not. We've had some drop in work. We performed some maintenance work for a couple of customers. We are in discussion with a few different carriers. We maintain confidence. We don't start paying rent until we have a base load customer. So we're out there aggressively talking with people. We have hired our first 30 group of mechanics, and we're in the process of interviewing more, and we're hoping that we can be up to work as early as the middle of January, maybe February with some business. That's what we're hoping for at this stage., Yes., Yeah. So my view is that we offer alternative solutions for the government. And typically, our solutions are lower cost in nature. And we're fairly optimistic that as the needs continue to grow and the pressure comes to contain cost, that we're in a pretty good position. So it's a little hard to predict precisely how the behavior will unfold come January 20, but we think we're in a good position to benefit at least from the signals that we're seeing so far., Thank you, Shannon., So Larry, I feel good about the business. I feel we're in a good position. The demand seems to be pretty robust. I feel good about our positioning. We're doing good work out of our shops so the heavy maintenance business has been relatively strong. The supply businesses in total have been strong. We had – the trading business was a little soft in the quarter, but better than the quarter before. And we're entering the fourth quarter with good momentum across all the businesses. So we feel good about the prospects for our Aviation Services businesses., I can't say that we're seeing anything unusual in that regard. So I believe that there is a mixture as new aircrafts are coming into the system. I believe a percentage of those aircrafts are for growth and a percentage are to replace some of the older aircraft. But at the end of the day, our business benefits from just having more aircraft in the system. So if you look at the Navy aircraft we'll be supporting, those are 737-700s, relatively modern aircraft, and if you look at the mix of most of our customers today, you will see that there is a good blend of newer aircraft and older aircraft., So I think as we move forward, I'm not sure if the price of fuel is playing a huge factor in this equation other than the airlines continue to do very well in this environment, and maintaining their schedules is important to them. So paying for the spare parts and the maintenance performed on a timely basis, I believe, is working in our favor. So there have been years passed where the airlines have deferred maintenance or they deferred inventory spend. I can't say that we're seeing that today., Yeah. The mobility business has continued to surprise us to the negative. That being said, we did have a nice win on this one contract in the quarter. And I believe that business will be tough here, continue to be tough for the near-term. At some point, the supplies are going to start diminishing the level of safety spares that the government maintains. And at that point, I would expect to see a pick-up in that business., So if you look at that business from a 30-year horizon standpoint, going back, you will have noted these kind of times where there was a downward pressure. So this will be similar to what we experienced in 1998, 1999, 2000, but again, we feel good about our leadership position in this field. We know that the product is necessary. It's just not being ordered today but it will be ordered and we'll be in a good position to deal with it. We're taking good actions around the cost side, so we're improving our competitiveness on a going-forward basis. And yeah, I think we're taking the right actions., Yeah, no, the April date, as it turned out, we had conflict in a few different things. I think now we're going back to October which is the timeframe we've historically held our Analyst Days. We tried to see if we could do it in July, but we ran into conflicts there with June's quarter earnings results. I think that was the same problem in April, too, as I think about it. So the October period is, I think – we'll run into some September quarter pressure but we're going to hold it a little earlier in October. So that's what we're shooting for., Yes., Hi, Rob., Hey, Rob., So let me turn it over to Tim to address the number of aircraft and an overall snapshot as to how we see things today., Yeah, so Rob, we are – we ended the quarter with the same 19 that we had on the first day of the quarter. Then we'll add three contract positions with the Falkland Islands contract. It's four aircraft but it's three contract positions. The 189s are two aircraft to make one because of the location., We'll have to see. We've got contract positions that are up, that have been rebid and we'll see if we're able to retain them. The pricing pressure is extremely difficult, and we're really not inclined to tie up our assets for long periods of time at this kind of pricing level. So we're being disciplined on our pricing and kind of taking a longer view. So we'll see. At the same time, we're also looking for the non-DOD kind of battlefield support, more search and rescue opportunities like the Falkland Islands to diversify our business., Well, there's excess capacity, right? There are players – if you know the helicopter market, you know that there's not very much good going on, right? The oil and gas aircraft are significantly under-utilized. The DOD aircraft are significantly under-utilized. Some of the firefighting are under-utilized. So there's plenty of assets out there. So, I guess it's fewer requirements from our core customer combined with a glut of equipment available., Well, there's one contract in particular that happens will get us very close to that. So, I think we're defining the business in a broader sense, so we have a large contract that's been – we haven't talked about necessarily but it's been talked about that we're competing on that, if that were to come our way, that would go a long way to achieving what you just mentioned., Yes. No. Win or lose. It's binary., Yup., Sure, Kevin., Yeah, we believe the revenues will be more or less equal throughout the period. Now there will be other aspects which will contribute based on over and above, and things of that nature. But in essence, think of it as evenly distributed over the five-year period., Yeah, Kevin, it's out of our control. So it's in the hands of the government and we have reason to believe that they're inclined to make a decision in the next 30 to 45 days., No., Yeah. So we're basically saying, for the last 60 years, we've been heavily involved in the fixed wing business, supporting fixed wing operators. We really entered the helicopter market with the acquisition of the airlift business back in 2010. We've been pretty busy flying airplanes. We always thought all along that we would – part of our strategy was to move into support for these asset types, and now we have the time, if you will, and resources to go ahead and do so. So we'll be approaching a broad-based market. We'll be looking to be in the supply and the repair ends of this market. And we'll pick our spots, we'll shoot for higher-margin opportunities and hopefully you'll start seeing some results coming out of this in the near-term., Yeah, I actually think there's so much dislocation in that market right now that it's an opportunity for somebody to come in with a clean balance sheet and a clean set – a new set of eyes to look at that market opportunistically, and that's how we're approaching it., Yeah., Okay., Adding on? So yeah, think of the growth in two perspectives. If you look at the growth that you've seen here the last year or so, it's all been organically generated. And we have a very healthy pipeline, , So we're still a relatively small player in a very big pond. So I think there is a fair amount – we have an ambitious leadership team. They're covering a lot of bases today and they see lots of markets that are still available for us to participate in. So I think look for organic growth in that give-or-take 10% range., And you'll note that there is very few people in this industry growing at that rate organically. As a matter of fact, you'd have a hard time pointing out any, at least, that are in the public domain that are growing at that rate organically. So we feel good about the organic growth prospects and the balance sheet is strong. I've indicated in the release today that we will look for acquisitions that make sense, and in that particular market, we're looking at a few different things. So I think our focus is on organic growth because it's fairly attractive, and secondly is look for acquisitions either bolt-on in nature or larger scale in nature. And we have our eyes open for both., I'd like to hear your reason before I respond., Yeah. So, , Now we're at an extreme point in time in that the Expeditionary businesses are at their low point, their absolute low point in the cycle. And our view is that this wouldn't be a good time to do what you just indicated because this isn't – we wouldn't be maximizing value. So we have long memories and even short memories, and these businesses are at leadership positions in their markets. It doesn't mean that we're married to these forever. Clearly, we're not., But at the same token, I think that the strategy of maintaining this two-prong capability is the right strategy at this moment. It doesn't mean that we're not going to explore different possibilities. And we have, as you know, we have a very dynamic board group. And once a year, we do in-depth strategic reviews at every quarterly board meeting. We have discussion about the company's strategy. So we'll continue to look at what's best for our shareholders., That's correct, $81 million., Well, we invested $35 million or $40 million this quarter in ways that we think are going to grow the business. We also invested $7 million or so in share repurchases. I mean, my preference is to grow the business and to use our capital base to grow the business. But from time-to-time, when we deem it appropriate, we will look to opportunistically purchase the shares. But we're not looking at purchasing the shares as a strategy to growth. We're looking at the purchasing of shares as a way to balance out our performance and the use of our capital., Right now, we're seeing some very interesting growth opportunities for the company, and we have in the period of time that we've been a net investor in the businesses and the way I'm seeing things today, I see us continuing to invest in the business as a priority to buying in the shares. It doesn't mean we're not going to buy any shares. It's just that my preference right now is to support the growth of the company and we're seeing some pretty attractive opportunities in this regard., Got it., Got it., Got it., Thank you."
1004,2017.0,Q&A,a,"Thanks, Larry., Yeah. The trading sales were up $22 million or 42%, and the commercial programs were up over $18 million., No, this is John Holmes. It's not unusual. We've had a nice recovery, I'll call it, over the last five or six quarters in the trading business and volume both for engine and airframe parts has actually been quite consistent over that period of time., Not anything unusual., Yeah. It was due to those one-time costs, we had some restructuring in one of our businesses that resulted in severance. And then we also had customer movement in our MRO business that incurred some cost as we transitioned customers from one facility to another., Yeah, there is existing revenue there, the two facilities. One of the facilities is full of other customers, in addition to Air Canada. We should mention that the Air Canada E jet work is being done in the one facility already today along with other customers. We plan to work with the existing customers to transition them either to the other Premier facility or other AAR facilities as the A320 portion of the Air Canada works pulls up., No., No, no. If anything, it could be the opposite where we take some of the work that exists there and move it to another one of our U.S. based facilities. But nothing from the U.S. will migrate to Canada., So this contract is not about moving and the acquisition is not about moving work or jobs outside the United States. In fact, this is purely around capturing business in the Canadian market and retaining business they currently do. But we're looking at this as a way to bolster our presence in the North American market, strengthen our position here in North America, which obviously is mostly U.S.-based., No., No. Neither facility with union., Neither facility with union., We should be able to share that information in a week-and-a-half or 10 days. So, at the end of next week, we'll have that information for you., Thank you., Sure, thanks., Well, you had a private owner, a entrepreneur, he was getting to an age where he was looking to retire and lessen his burden, if you will. The businesses were growing, and I think the timing was right for him and it was right for us and it was right for Air Canada. So I think you can see there is a connection between the acquisition and the contract signing with Air Canada and I think he was helpful in making all that happen., I can't say that, I – you never know that things are 100% wise, right. I mean, we've had a longstanding relationship with Air Canada. Air Canada introduced us to these folks and there may have been others, but I can't tell you that they were or they weren't, I don't know., Yeah, thanks for the question. Growing that distribution business has been a big part of our strategy for the last few years, and we've seen a lot of success in capturing this exclusive distributorship, just like the AMETEK deal. I'd say the value proposition for us relative to our two largest competitor, Aviall and Satair, is our independents and our channels to market. So, with the growth of the power-by-the-hour business, with the growth of the MRO business, we have a number of touch points with the customers that allow us to push the OEMs' product in a way that our competitors may not be., So, Boeing, of course, is a very different company than AAR, and Boeing has made some noise about looking at the – in the avionics industry in a way that they haven't the past largely due to their interest in capturing more aftermarket activity and I believe you see in UTC-Collins transaction., I believe that Boeing, our relation with Boeing today is, they're our supplier, they're our customer and they're our competitor. They were a competitor on the flydubai transaction. And I'm sure they will win some competitions and they will be a good competitor, but nevertheless, I think we offer speed, customer familiarization, a broader product line offering in that we can support, not just your Boeing fleet, but also your Airbus and Bombardier and Embraer air fleet and this is our core fundamental business., We understand that particularly around maintenance, we understand how to get the aircraft in and out of hangars quickly and safely. On the supply chain business, we understand how to value inventories in ways that might be a little tougher for somebody like Boeing, plus as I indicated, we go across the different platforms and aren't Boeing centric or Airbus centric, but can really focus on the customer and their solutions set., So, we don't believe that their interest in the aftermarket is necessarily competitive to our interest, but time will tell. We feel good about our positioning., Well, October 31 should be the latest date. We remain hopeful we might hear something sooner, but as of today, no later than October 31., Yeah. Thank you., Hey, , Thanks., Yes. So , Yes., Yeah. So , So our first priority remains investing in the business and then we'll look for ways to get capital back to our shareholders as we've also demonstrated over the last three to four years. So we've given back through share repurchase and dividends about $250 million and we have a recent reauthorization, a share repurchase authorization, I should say, by the board to refresh our last authorization, which was for $250 million worth of our stock and we will, from time to time, be returning capital in that fashion., Yeah. Well, we have a healthy liquidity position in excess of $300 million and we will be financing the Premier transaction with a specific piece of Canadian dollar based financing and so our liquidity remains strong. We are investing in the business on Q1. We were a net investor, a net consumer of cash, I should say. And we would expect that through the balance of the year, we'll be a net generator of cash., So we're very cognizant of the transaction. We do business with both United Technologies and Collins. We don't anticipate that those relationships – we're not anticipating any change in our relationship. We're a little bit tighter with UT than we would be with Collins. So if anything, hopefully, the UT management will encourage Collins to do more business with us. So, as we sit here today, we view it neutral to potentially positive., Yeah. It was. True., Thanks. , Good afternoon, , 
            , Yeah. Thanks for asking about that. Yeah, the contract is going well. We're live on – in other two contracts, the NG contract and the MAX contract. We're live on both. And we expect that our contract will be extended to cover the additional aircraft that they just ordered., 
            , Yes. Yes, we're very pleased and I believe State Department is very pleased as well and we've seen that we put a great team on the field., Thanks., What I would view is I'd view the contribution, the ramp as modest., So, Larry, I think best – I think we're trying to indicate where our thinking is, right, in terms of where we're taking that business. I think you can see that hopefully. And I will be in a better position to comment, as I indicated, at the January Investor Day., We believe so, yes. Yes, we believe so., Yeah, go ahead., Yeah. So the first question, in this quarter, we saw growth across the board, so the trading business, the distribution business, MRO, and programs all contributed, so everybody had a good quarter. And can you repeat your second – the second half of your question?, It was a mix. And each of the businesses, I would say, showed a little improvement in gross margins. So similar to sales, we saw growth across – the improvement across the board there and we do believe it's sustainable., Well, our effective – we basically are moving our effective tax rate in line with our estimates of where we think that will be. The deferred taxes, we did not make an adjustment for that in that estimate, but we'll recognize that as we go forward in next year., So as it relates to digital, there's a couple of ways to think about that. We're excited to get Andrew on the team. He's already – we're already learning a lot from him. We're thinking about digital across the whole company and it will impact different areas of the business in different ways. We're looking at it from really two standpoints, one is the refresh of the way our systems work and the way our people interact with those systems to get them more efficient. And the second is using digital data analysis, et cetera, to drive traditional – to drive sales of our traditional businesses. So we've got a number of efforts underway to be more robust in terms of how we collect and analyze data to better price things and ultimately capture more market share., I mean, in general, we see positive trends in terms of inputs., I think we'll talk about that a bit more in detail in January., No, you're right, it was $29.4 million, it's down to $9.3 million, it's down $20 million. So I'm sorry about that., Yeah. , There is still some revenue coming in. And so the difference is down $20 million., Right., Yeah – no., Yes, we can quantify, there was none., Yeah., Yeah, there was none, yeah., Yeah, it's ramping up or will ramp up as expected and we'll start seeing contribution in the Q4 time period., I don't know if I'd characterize it as a big gap. We felt that we have a IT organization in the company that we've had for a long time and then the Digital Services group is about 18 months old, and they were really existing separately. What Andrew's skillset brings to us is the ability to have both of those organizations inside the company report to one person, because there's a lot of overlapping efforts and we're looking to him to coordinate that., We – at the MRO conference over in London a few months back, we launched a few of our new digital services. We've got a parts store, so we're selling parts online. We've got some portals that we put out to help our program customers. And Andrew's got a whole pipeline of ideas that we'll continue to add to that portfolio of digital products. So, bringing the digital team, the traditional IT team together and continuing to come up with new ideas for digital innovation is what we're looking for from Andrew., It's a new heavy maintenance relationship. We've had a relationship with Republic for some time., Good afternoon, sir., It's a pretty mature product at this point. We continue to see a robust opportunity pipeline. And we can talk a bit more about the number of opportunities at the January conference., Yes, we continue to have interest in Rockford. We're doing work for three different customers up there right now. The big focus for us in the MRO facilities is attracting talent, technicians. And we are starting to see some pressure in certain markets on wages., Yeah, there's $50 million – yeah, exactly, there's incremental $4 million in there which included the SG&A fees and incremental legal and deal-related costs., Yes, that's right., It sounds right., Yeah., If you back out the exceptional items, you're correct., Let us – give us one second, just kind of , Just one second., Hey. So guys, so the answer, the run rate, so what you're saying is we would add another $0.03 to the $0.38 or $0.41., $0.38. So you got the $0.35, the $0.03 we're indicating is the losses at the business and another $0.03 on top of that for the one-off exceptionals., In the SG&A., $2.6 million of the $3.6 million is included in the impairment., Right, correct., That's right. That's right., Correct., That's correct., Hey, Larry, just to be clear, so it's $1 million plus another $400,000 that we indicated. So it's $1.4 million or $1.3 million that get you to $0.03, okay? Next question?, Lack of strength in the parts businesses across the board to commercial customers. So we are getting traction from some of our program wins, but I believe we are doing a really good job across all the different businesses in that segment., Nothing that stands out. I think we had good results throughout the businesses. I think we are starting to benefit from some of the investments we've made and some of the actions we've taken in prior periods. So, yeah, I think you can see hopefully continued performance coming from our parts businesses., Yeah., Right. Larry, so there's a lot of noise coming out of the market that is kind of indicative of demand about to come. We haven't seen it yet, but we are getting a sense that there may be some positive stuff out there for us. Now, we've had that before, but at least there – currently at least, there is some noise indicating there may be some interest in our services., Yes, yes., Yeah, that's correct. That's correct., We've had legal expenses throughout on this program., But we're just – we're pointing it out. And that's correct, that's already absorbed in our result., Well, we're very driven to get – to bring our SG&A down to historical levels, below 10%. So we'd be happy being in the 9% to 9.5% range..., Today we are at 10.6%. If you take out the legal expenses you get a few basis point reduction, but basically what we're counting on right here is get some sales growth., Yeah, I would say so., We've been led to believe, no. But obviously the current planning is outside of our purview, if you will, but we've been led to believe that there'll be little to no impact., I think what you're seeing from our vantage point is more of a market share grab on our part. You have seen some new wins and growth with new customers. So I think the spending patterns with our customer base, there hasn't been anything noticeable in that regard., I just think in AAR's case, I think what you are seeing is growth in our market share., Well, I – we made a significant investment in BD capability around this program activity and you're seeing some of the fruits of that effort and energy. And I think we're just doing a better job, geographic dispersion of our – the balance of our supply businesses. I mean, there is a reason for opening up a plant in Dubai, and I think our guys are executing – our guys and gals are executing beautifully., Yeah. So our relationship with Boeing, which would be similar to some of the other large OEs, would be; in some cases we compete, in some cases we supply, and in some cases we purchase. So, to-date our relationships with Boeing have not really been impacted by any of their announcements in any meaningful fashion. And we would anticipate – we don't see much in the way of change. We are very cognizant of their statements and we're kind of focused on execution here at the company and expanding our capabilities and to continue doing our thing. So, yes, we're aware of them. We are aware of their ambitions. But yet, we've not seen any change in terms of our relationship with them., Yeah., Well, let me first start by saying that I think what you are seeing in our announcement is a bullish attitude around our Aviation Service business, particularly supporting commercial customers. We also see opportunities supporting government customers and are awaiting hopefully some positive news on a few different fronts that we're working on., In terms of our Expeditionary Service work last year, you may recall that we expanded with the search and rescue contract down in the Falklands in support of the British MOD and we continue to look for opportunities of that nature pretty much around the globe. Our BD team is working it fairly aggressively. I'm not in a position today to report on any progress per se, but I would be hopeful that a year from now or so that we would have some successful stories to communicate., Yeah. So we would be hopeful that most – in terms of the contracts that we've announced, that most of the spend has already taken place. So we would anticipate positive cash flows coming from those investments. That said, I wouldn't want to limit us around new contracts that might be in the pipeline as well. So we have been growing at a fairly significant clip. Some of these programs require capital. Some programs require less capital, but we are – to answer your question in terms of the current order book, we would anticipate positive cash flows, and then we'll – we may be making similar investments if we're successful in other contracts of this nature., Yeah. I think that's a good way to look at it. Yeah., Yes., Thank you., Thank you., Hi, Shannon., Yeah. So the IndiGo contract is more of a labor contract. So it's a maintenance contract to support their landing gear and that would have been business we won away from competition., I think we had 16 at the end of the quarter, and I'm not sure what we have in 2016. Do you have..., We can get back to you on that, Shannon, we'll get back to you., Yes. So, there is a little bit of volatility quarter-to-quarter just based on how the other businesses within that segment perform. So I would say, plus or minus where we should be in that range., It is., Yeah. So we haven't seen the details of the budget related to spend on the type of things we produce. We are seeing an uptick in activity around some of our container product lines, and there's noise elsewhere in that business as well. But the influx of orders is – we've had steady flow, not a huge influx of orders for that business. In terms of the mobility – the Airlift business which is the other part of our Expeditionary Services, there's where we're seeing noise coming out of the theater and from commanders looking for support., No, that would be something we would own..., ...and that would be in the operational budget of the DoD., Thank you., Yeah, just one second, see if we can get it real quick. $41 million., Yeah. I think, we can stay with what we've shared in the past. I think 5% to 10% range is the range we're comfortable with., Yeah. By the end of this quarter., Yeah. So as you know, the summer months are weaker months from a maintenance standpoint, because the aeroplanes are out there flying. But we're setting ourselves up to have a another pretty decent year for MRO, and we feel we have pretty good alignment that we're looking at in terms of customers and facilities. And we've brought the Rockford facilities on line now, it's doing work, it was profitable in the Q4 period. And we're kind of excited about what the prospects might be for that as well., Mobility is doing a little bit better. Airlift, you're correct, we've lost some positions, but the Mobility business has seen a little bit more order flow. Still not where it's been, but still better than recent past., Yes., So legal is 98%, I mean it's mostly related to the , Yeah. So we're technically an intervener in DynCorp's lawsuit against the U.S. government. And we will continue to spend money in that role and hopefully the process will conclude by the October 31 date, and we once expect much in the way of legal expense. They have to analyze. The DynCorp continues the process., No, I think the strategy is no different than it's been. What we're looking to do was kind of replenish the authorization. We have had a $250 million authorization back in 2014, and we went to , Hey, Rob., We had the benefit from the taxes a little less than the after tax impact of kind of the special..., What I'd like to – first of all, fourth quarter is historically a strong quarter. So you have airlines getting ready to service their customers for the summer months. So you have the shops are pretty full and the spare part supply is pretty robust. So that's been a trend for the last 15 years, maybe 20 years here at the company. What I would like to do Rob is, we have our Investor Day in October, we'll be coming out with a date here pretty soon. What I'd like to do is, kind of give you, share at that point a little bit more feel for how we see the trend, if you will, in the business. Right now, we feel pretty bullish on things, but I just want to let little time pay us, let John get a little bit more ensconce in his position, and then by around October we should be able to get a little bit more color., No. , When we released it we were putting together our minutes from the board meeting, and we just released it as part of normal course of business. So we got the authorization yesterday during the day. It was some we meant to get out last night and get around to it, and we got it written up this morning during our session with the board and got it out today. So we weren't thinking about the afterhours or before hours., Not that we see, nothing that is apparent. But I guess, I would reserve my comment on that to lay out the actual execution, but nothing that is apparent., So let me share with you how we're thinking about the businesses, because we're really thinking about the businesses as being integrated and having an integrated solution. And as we think about our strategy, we think about these pieces and are they connected to each other, and as we think about growing the company, we think about growing them in this fashion. So at this stage, I would prefer to focus more around thinking of these businesses as a collective group of businesses designed to give us a powerful value proposition for our customers, and I believe that that strategy is working. And I don't think at this stage it would be wise to deviate from that. So I prefer to speak in terms of the businesses and their totality., Yeah., Yeah. Right. I'm thinking aggregate is 5% to 10%. Yes. That's what I'm saying., Yeah. So we'll drill down a little bit further at the Investor Day. So why don't we kind of wait on that till then, and leave it at that., Thank you., The last date was August 9th. We then went out with a 8-K filing and laid out the dates between now and October 31. So there was a delay in the process, and we articulated that through an 8-K filing., Shutdown., No. We will be hopeful that we could get on schedule on the ramp. We had enough time to think about it. So we're pretty prepared, and I think the customers – yeah, I mean we're pretty prepared., We have reasons to believe that a decision will be known before the month is out. So we're hopeful that we'll hear something on that before July 31., So on the Mobility, we're seeing an increase in dialogue around opportunities with the customers, some new product development actually, as well as some of the traditional products. On the Airlift, we've won some, we've , No, we have no visibility., Thanks, Ben., Yes. So I think, so I mean, Tim just laid out for you some of the headwinds we faced with the KC-10 wind-down., That's right., We will expect the legal expenses to be lower., We believe that there is room for improvement, yes. So we believe as we succeed more in providing integrated solutions that it not just creates more value for our customer, but we also think it creates more value for our shareholders as well., Yeah. I think as it relates to next year, because of items you mentioned, I think we're expecting relatively flat., Yeah. So first of all, we and one of the – as you've seen me indicate, we have different – we look at the application of capital across a few different possibilities, and one of the possibilities of course is investing in the business itself. So if you look at the year that just ended, we spent money buying inventories to support some of these programs that we've recently won. We will maintain a balanced approach based on the cash needed to fund the growth of the business, and look at the cash that is available and the ratios that are available to us in terms of EBITDA to debt. We'll keep surveilling that and make determinations based on the share price, based on other uses of our capital as to when is the right time to be investing in the stock. We do not expect to have a debt offering, or there has been no discussion at all about a debt offering to fund the purchases of the stock. And I want to be careful and not signaling any changes from how we've been behaving to-date, just that we're looking to refresh what we had previously authorized, and giving the company some flexibility as it relates to applications of capital. So please don't be expecting anything unusual to take place., My recollection is that it's slightly – there's two components to the KC-10, there is the slide hour piece which is below – you may recall we're reporting it at zero margin, and then there is the over and above which have a pretty healthier margin. So my sense is that the gross profit line is probably below our blended rate., Cash flow from operations was $33 million in Q4., Larry, do you get that?, Yeah. What I'd like to do again here is I'd like to have a chance in this regard that may have to be a little later than October. I want to have a chance to see the impacts of the ramp of all these different contracts because the pace of ingestion has been pretty rapid here. And the first step for us is to make sure we can satisfy the requirements that the customer has. And so we're making the investments we feel are necessary for that. And now we have to give these programs the chance to ramp and take a look what the ongoing costs are against the revenues that come in. So I prefer at this stage to give ourselves a little bit more time to see how that evolves., We have internal targets, but I'd prefer to see how we actually perform before commenting."
1004,2018.0,Q&A,a,"Hey, Rob. How are you?, Yeah, sure. On the realignment, given the supply of labor and systems that's inherent in the GOCO business and the fact that the core government programs business is very strong in that area, we felt from a management and synergy perspective that it made a lot more sense to have those two businesses run alongside each other. And so far, that's off to a great start, as I mentioned, the State Department has been extremely pleased with our transition on INL and that that team in Aviation Services that's running this is doing a great job., Right. Fair comment or fair question. So, inside that business, the larger portion of it is our mobility business, the shelters, containers and pallet business. And that business right now, it's at a moment in time where it's up from last year but overall at a low point. The backdrop for that business we actually feel quite good about. We've announced a few awards in the last couple of quarters and they've got a number of opportunities they're bidding and RFPs that they've responded to., So we're feeling pretty good about that business given the macro environment doing well. And that – the other business in that area is the composites business, but mobility is the bulk of the revenue in Expeditionary Services, and we're feeling pretty good about the growth prospects there., Right., Well, we saw – at the operating margin level, we were up 0.5 points year-over-year. So, if you think about the mix, we've seen a great deal of strength in our parts supply businesses and the distribution and the trading business and the commercial programs business as well as the government programs business outside of INL continue to grow. So, we're very encouraged by the growth rates in all of those areas. And as you know, those businesses are higher margin than MRO., Yeah, I would – as you know, we've got a long-term growth projection or goal of 5% to 10%. And so we feel good about that range., Yeah., Sorry, Rob, say that again?, There was, yeah, we did have lower MRO volumes in the quarter, and you do have a fixed cost base in that business that the volumes – the fixed cost didn't come out obviously. So you saw a lower gross margin, slightly lower gross profit margin in that regard. We do expect a much stronger quarter in MRO in Q2. So we expect that to improve., Yes, predominantly. Yes., Yeah. And just one more point..., ...I don't want to lose sight of the strength in the parts businesses and the strength in the programs businesses. I mean, those businesses are doing exceptionally well right now and we can see – continue to see opportunity to invest in those. And those are – as I just mentioned, those are stronger margin businesses than MRO., Thanks, Rob., Yeah. You saw a little bit of impact from INL as well as MRO. But again, the SG&A as a percentage of sales came down, so our operating margin, while we saw 0.2% decrease in gross profit margin, we saw 0.5 point increase in op margin in the same period., It could continue. As I mentioned, we've got – so, first of all, you're right in that seasonally that's the reason, and historically, we've had opportunities with lessors to fill certain slots. Those lessors have had those aircraft operating, and those leases have been extended, so we didn't see those one-off drop in opportunities this season., We do, as I mentioned, we do have some open slots as we go into the next quarter or two, but we've got a number of opportunities that we're focused on right now to fill up those slots., And seasonally, the business gets stronger as we go through the rest of the year., It's – yeah, it's correct. Yeah, it's a mixture of everything. Seasonally, you get a pickup there, but again, the parts businesses and the programs businesses are performing very well, and those are higher margin businesses than MRO. So, even if you have a little bit of softness in MRO, we still see improved margins as a result of the strength of those businesses., Yes, yes, we're right where we expected to be., Yeah., We do have contracts in hand, and that was just filling individual orders, the timing of filling those individual orders. But overall, we feel good about the growth of that business for the balance of the year., No, we are not., No, we're not., We're not., Just ongoing incentive programs of, like, the stock performed well and the company has performed well and, as a result, the expense has been a little bit higher., All of the above. We've got a very active process going on right now with a number of parties to exit that business, and it's a big focus of ours to complete that soon., Yeah. That's our plan., Hey, Ken., Sure. I'll give you an unsatisfying answer. We feel good about the pipeline. We've been growing at a faster rate than the overall market for that, and we've been taking market share. We've got a very healthy base of 1,300 supported aircraft at this point. And our marginal cost to support a new aircraft is lower than it was a year ago, so we're becoming more competitive in that market. And we feel good about the pipeline, it remains very strong., It's both. It's both. It's taking share as well as moving with the market., Yeah, we wouldn't want to – we don't comment on the individual growth rates., Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you're probably not too far off., Well, the labor market remains tight. Going into this busy season, we do feel much better prepared to deal with the tight labor market than we did last year at this time. So we're encouraged by that. We are a leader in this market and our performance is what we're focused on right now, and through strong performance, we expect to command – and we've seen this over and over again with our customers, we expect to command a better pricing in the market. We – yeah. Yeah., Going forward, Ken, we expect our tax rate to be 23% to 24% on a quarterly basis., Thanks, Ken., Thanks, Ken., Hey, Josh., Yeah. They're both growing. They're both growing nicely. And again, we are growing as a result of taking market share as well as benefiting from the overall trends., Yes. So, thanks for asking about that. That's going well. We continue to be under construction in the facility. It's been slightly delayed due to weather conditions over there, but we are on track for a first calendar quarter 2019 opening, and we're working on securing our first base load of customers., So, it depends, it depends on if we have the maintenance slots available when the aircraft come out and it also depends on whether or not those leases get extended with the lessees. In other words, when we talk about doing work with the lessors, it means that the aircraft are transitioning from one operator to another and that lessor puts that aircraft to us for an interim check. If the lease is extended with the existing operator and that existing operator is not a customer of AAR's, then that work is going to stay with wherever that operator has got it. So it just depends on ultimately what happens with the movement of those aircraft., Hey, Mike., Yeah. At this point, Mike, we're about 23% to 24%. In the quarters going forward, we don't – we'll probably be a little favorable to that rate over the course of the full year., Yeah, it's what you said. It's the seasonal strength will pull up the gross margins and the continued growth in the parts and programs businesses which are higher margins businesses. So we do expect to see improvement there., Yeah. As I mentioned, I know it's still a tight market, but a number of the things that we – the number of the initiatives that we put in place in order to deal with that are working and we feel much better going into the busier season., No, it would not., Yeah. But..., No. No. And if I'm thinking of the same release, that's not necessarily heavy maintenance that would be in conflict with the work we do for them., Okay. Thank you., Hey, Ben. We see it as fairly steady. At the Investor Day, we articulated we see it as about a $200 million a year contract and we do see that evenly spread throughout the year now that we're full run rate., Yeah. In this quarter, we saw a similar growth rate both the domestic and international growth. But international remains a big focus of ours. We've got a great sales team worldwide, as you can see, they're having a lot of success capturing business. We're excited about this India joint venture in getting a facility up and running over there to take the AAR brand farther East. So international expansion is a real focus of ours., Yeah. So the – it's under protest. No surprise there. And my – I believe we've got about another month to go under the GAO protest timeline. So, we would hope that, by the end of the calendar year, we'd see the first task orders coming out. But that is a fluid situation given the number of bidders on the IDIQ. So, that's just a guess., Yeah., Certainly, we understand the interest in getting more granular detail. We're in an ongoing dialogue with the auditors and others about the segment reporting, and that's something we'll continue to assess., All right, great. Thank you., That's right., We're in line with expectations at this point, and consistent with what we articulated at the Investor Day, we've got a target to get back to that 10%. We got targets to get back to that 10% or slightly below run rate. And as the business continues to grow throughout the year, we expect continued improvement there., We're expanding through investments in material and people. We've been very successful over the last several years. A number of our competitors have gone away and we've been able to take their share. We've got a wonderful team. They're extremely in touch with those markets. They're able to sniff out opportunities better than anybody else out there. And our goal right now is to continue to back the team that we've got., Certainly, fuel prices and the commentary coming out of our customers is something we're keeping a close eye on. But, right now, given our position in the market, the demand that we see for material over the next several years as well as our ability to access the material, which is a core competency of ours, we're quite confident., Rob, we're always looking. We're always looking. As we've said, the last few quarters, our cash is being invested in organic growth which obviously we're seeing. But we're always – we've always got our eye open for the right opportunity., There are things out there, as you know, as valuations are very healthy and we always had a very disciplined approach to M&A, and there's nothing that's going to change our approach., Yeah. Thanks, Ken. That's a good question. We see both. We see growth in current distribution – with current distribution partners, and then we see a very healthy pipeline of opportunities for new distribution partners. And the success of that business is feeding on itself in a lot of ways. We're really becoming known for this service both to commercial customers because we have so many different channels to market such as with our MRO business or our parts business or our programs business, we have multiple touch points with commercial customers and the OEMs that we partner with like that. And then we've also had a great deal of success selling into the DLA which has turned into a real nice franchise. So, the pipeline is strong and it's a business that we continue to have high expectations of growth., Yeah. Right now, we're focused on getting India up and running getting those initial customers secured and getting some success there. And because of the position that that puts us in, we feel that that will be a great launch point into other ventures. But right now, we're focused on getting – being successful in the deal we've got in front of us., All right. Thanks, Ken., Thanks, Ken., Hey, Rob. How are you?, Yeah. Sure., Sure. Yeah, happy to do that. So, labor has been a consistent theme for a few quarters now, and we continue to make moves to address it. But you're absolutely right, last quarter we talked a bit about open slots that we needed to fill in the back half of our year. We're happy that we have been able to fill the majority of those slots and still got a little bit work to do at the tail end of the fourth quarter, but we've got a number of opportunities that we're chasing. So, in terms of filling our maintenance gaps, that's looking better., In terms of the labor situation, we continue to have some shortages in a couple of our largest sites. The thing that has – that's encouraging is the dialogue with our customers. As I mentioned, we've been successful in renegotiating two pricing agreements with a couple of our larger customers that certainly is good, and I would say the overall tone with the customers has improved since we first started talking about this over the last couple of quarters. In other words, the market is becoming very aware of this challenge and the customers valuing us as a supplier, valuing the service that we provide. They want to make sure that they're being a good partner to us. So, all of the – it's a pretty – it's a dynamic situation, but we're working all these initiatives in parallel, and for all those reasons we're feeling better about the second half., Yeah, we have seen some margin compression and that's showing up in our gross profit margin. And right now, in many cases we're dealing with timing. In other words, we're collecting a certain amount, our real costs have gone up, and it just takes some time to work through these agreements with the customers. So we have seen it. I expect we'll see it here for a little bit. But net-net, the things are trending in the right direction., Yeah, we've been seeing a whole – a number of opportunities in late life packages, and we trade in that world, as a matter of course, whole aircraft relatively frequently. What is good about the equity partnership that we signed when they appear is they'll be providing the majority of equity capital for us to go after larger transactions. I mean, these are transactions that we come across all the time in ordinary course of business, and we're close to that market and we've got – we believe there's going to be even more of them based on where we are in the cycle. And we expect to see more deals, and it's good to have equity capital alongside of us that we can – so we can pursue those larger transactions without doing it fully with our own balance sheet., Rob, we will evaluate those on an ongoing basis; but at this point, don't have any specific concerns that we've reserved again. So we feel good about the quality of our customer base at this point in time. And to the extent that we obviously were working with our airline customer in the past, and working to address it, but it was unfortunate that they went through the bankruptcy process., We – I think it's important to know..., ...this is the – Rob, just one more thing on that. This is the first failure of any significance that we've had any meaningful exposure to in at least 10 years. So this is something we pay a lot of attention to, as a matter of course., We feel really good about the – we feel – the short answer is, we feel very good about the overall macro trends, and we're still seeing a lot of demand particularly again on the parts, the trading, the distribution, the programs side. We still see demand in MRO. And even if you look at the Aviation Services segment, if you were to back out MRO from that, you would have seen that those other businesses trading, distribution, and parts are up 33% year-over-year. That's exceptionally strong growth in those areas., Sure, sure., No, that's all program, that's all programs., Yeah. Sure, sure. So INL did $43 million of sales in the quarter. But I think that it's important to note that we consider INL core business, and..., Yeah. And we could..., Right. We consider INL core business and it's part of an overall program strategy., And there's several other GOCO opportunities that we're going to be chasing that are very similar to INL, and some of them are quite meaningful in size., And one of the great things about AAR is we've got this mix in our portfolio of government and commercial; and if you looked at the results, you actually saw an increase in the government as a percentage of the sales this quarter. And we've got a long-term goal to get that closer to 50% government, 50% commercial. And again, we view wins like INL as part of that core business. But the short answer to your question is $43 million on INL for the quarter., Yeah, good question. You're absolutely right. This was our first full quarter of operation in INL, and I might add that it's going extremely well. It's going extremely well. And we – what we are learning now that we've been on the contract for a few months is that there is, within a period, variability in terms of material consumption based on how they operate the aircraft. So that is, as we are learning, we are going to see some variability in revenue. We still believe that overall it should be viewed as a $200 million a year customer account, but we are going to see some variability as it relates to that material spend. From a profitability expectation, it is right in line with our expectations profitability-wise., Yeah., Yeah., Yeah. I think – yeah, I think you've got that right. The demand came back this quarter, and again across all of our commercial businesses we saw strong demand and expect to see continued strong demand going forward. But you're absolutely right. We saw demand. And in certain cases, at certain of our sites, we were not able to answer that demand because we couldn't get the mechanics. And it's not just about getting the mechanics, it's about getting the right level of experience..., ...to produce, again, quality aircraft at the right level of efficiency, and that's a big part of the equation as well., I mean, it's – we'll be better in the second half of the year than we are in the first half of the year in MRO. But..., I think it's important to reiterate that even with the slowness in MRO, we still have 51% earnings growth, and excluding KC-10 wind-down, 21% top line growth. So, again, that should give you a sense for the momentum and the exceptional performance that we're seeing around the company., Isn't large opportunities, high level Ts enough?, Yeah. , So we have a couple of bids, significant bids that have been submitted., We have a couple more that we're expecting to see in the way of an RFP. And so, the timing on the bids that have been submitted were obviously at the mercy of the government here. So we're hopeful that those will be announced sometime in the first calendar quarter of next year., Okay., Yeah., Yeah. On Expeditionary Services, the mobility business itself is actually doing quite well. We recently got another – it's up year-over-year. We recently got some more funding for additional pilot orders come through, which we like to see. The softness there is actually out of our composites operation. There was a program that we had in place at this time last year, the distance completed. There are some other new programs that we've won. The start dates have just been delayed. So that's what's showing up in the softness inside Expeditionary., Great., Hey, Ken. How are you doing?, You're seeing a positive impact at the operating margin, but negative at the gross profit margin. That's predominantly MRO. We just have fixed costs that we haven't fully been able to leverage because we have not been at capacity. INL was a little bit of a factor in there. But the majority of it is because the lower MRO volumes., Yeah, it's – we've filled the gaps through the middle of the fourth quarter. We got a little bit work to do at the very tail end of the year, but we've got a number of opportunities that we're looking to close those gaps. But, definitely, progress has been made sense since we talked about it last quarter., I'm sorry. Which business, Ken?, Yeah, it's a mix of both. I mean, we've had long-term contracts that continue to expand, particularly on the government side. We've had – commercial has done very well as well, but we've also seen a nice uptick since the budget has been in place on the government side. And then, the deals that we have announced are really just starting to kick in. So if you're thinking about it in terms of same-store sales, we've seen an increase certainly in same-store sales, but some of these deals that we've signed in the last few quarters are now starting to contribute as well., Yeah, great question. I'd say, overall, it's been relatively consistent. We have seen some very aggressive pricing out of certain of our competitors. And we – as you and I have discussed, we have a pretty disciplined approach to these things relative to our return requirements, and certainly when we can hit those return requirements and win the business we do, and otherwise we're happy to let it go to other people. But the overall pipeline has been relatively consistent in terms of opportunities over the last couple of years, and we're invited to every bid process. Three or four years ago, I wouldn't have been able to say that, but when an airline sends out an RFP, we're on the list, alphabetically right at the top., Yeah., Sure. So, Napier is a -as I mentioned, it's a private equity firm that got a multibillion fund. They're run actually out of both New York and London, and we have partnered with them in the form of a joint venture, and they own no aircraft, at least in our – the part of the market or the asset types that we'll be chasing with them. They have no existing portfolio. So they're bringing money to the table., And as I mentioned it before, we are extremely active in these markets. We see lots of opportunities that come out of lessors and airlines, et cetera. But opportunities that – candidly, would be more significant that we would want to chase with our own balance sheet. Yeah, we're in the market, we're very active and therefore we're seeing them. So that led us to go out and seek a financial partner, and we found a great one with Napier. And so they'll be providing the majority of the capital. We'll put in some of our own equity capital, and we'll go out and we'll buy whole aircraft to trade, potentially aircraft to put on a very shortly – very short-term lease, but then ultimately trade out of. And the target of that is, as we mentioned, late life aircraft., In terms of profitability and revenue, it wouldn't be right for me to necessarily comment on that right now, but we're excited to get going and starting to deploy the capital that we've lined up., Well, it's – the answer is, yes, it's scalable, and I think it's not only scalable with other parties, but Napier has – they've got quite a bit more equity capital. They've allocated an exclusive amount to this particular joint venture, which is significant. But there's more capital behind that, just with this partner, that could be available to us as we get some success here. But..., Yeah, and then beyond, that seeking other partners, I think that's something that's a potential as well., Thanks, Ken., Hey, Mike., No, I mean, it certainly – it was part of the discussion. I wouldn't say it was a driving factor by any means. We've – even before oil went up and then came back down again, we've been seeing meaningful opportunities over the past year plus, which is what led us to go out to the market and look for a partner so that we could participate in a more significant way. But certainly, the price of fuel and its impact on the longevity of these late light assets is something that we're considering are a big – as a factor as we go out and do deals., We are. We haven't disclosed that for competitive reasons, but we've got a very, I would say, defined view or the type of opportunities we want to pursue., So, MRO will be down year-over-year as part, and again that's being offset by a tremendous growth elsewhere in the business that we talked about. I think that's – in terms of a percentage right now, I'll just – I'll leave it at that. And as we go through the year, we can provide more color., It would be. It is effectively a share loss at the moment, but what I would characterize it is we have customers that have – we have contracts with customers and those contracts give us a certain number of lines of maintenance. Now, those lines of maintenance are constantly being adjusted by the customers based on changes to their fleet schedules and how they want to operate their aircraft. But we – based on those contracts and the lines of maintenance that we have when we are recovered from a labor standpoint and have capacity to take those lines back, they're still under contracts with us. So a customer might say, listen, I got an aircraft to send to you; we'll say, well, listen, we can't take it now, but we can take the next one. That aircraft goes to somebody else on a one-off basis, and when we've got the mechanics it can come back to us., Yeah. We are – it's progressing. And as we said in the last call, our goal is to have that completed by the end of this fiscal year., Okay. Thank you., Josh., Well, I mean, M&A in general, we're actively looking. The investments that we've been making have been obviously for organic growth. And again, we're very proud of the organic growth that we put up this quarter, getting up to that $0.59 number. So that's where the focus is right now, that's where the focus is right now in terms of our capital. Having said that, there are a number of opportunities that we are aware of, that we're tracking, that we may see come to market, and could be a good fit for us. But right now, the focus is on organic investment, and obviously you're seeing in the results with the strong quarter., Yeah, that..., Yes, that has the $25 billion IDIQ. So that was protested. It was clear to protest. They're now in the process of bidding task orders. It's clear that the government wants to get task orders awarded as quickly as possible, and we're hoping to hear some news on that early in 2019., Great. Thank you., Thanks, Josh., Thank you. Thanks, Ken., Thanks, Ken., Yeah. From a revenue standpoint, consistent with what we talked about in January, it's about a $200 million contract in FY 2019 and it's close to that range with the flight regulate start., Correct., Sure. You're right. We're looking, as I said, at being a net investor in the first half of the year and going to positive cash flow generation in the second half of the year. We're still viewing our cash flow for the full year in the range that we communicated at the January Investor Day, which would be 50% EBITDA conversion for the year. And in terms of the accounts receivable, and that's..., Consistent., You go ahead, Mike., Yeah. Ken, that assumes that the use of the facility, AAR facility, will be consistent., That's constant. Yes, right., Thanks, Ken., If you take our KC-10, growth would've been roughly 8.5% which is in the range that we've been communicating, 5% to 10%. So we don't see it as any start of a trend. We continue to see, as I mentioned, demand across all of the businesses in the Aviation Services unit. So the short answer is I wouldn't view that as part of a trend. And 8.5%, backing out KC-10, is right in line with what we've been expecting., Yeah. I would view those two things differently on the hourly labor, and that's where we see the pressure. As I mentioned in the last call, we certainly are in communication. All of the customers are aware of the tightness in the labor supply and the potential downstream implications for costs. The last thing that the customers want to see is us raising our price to them. So we're doing what we can with a number of other options that I mentioned to broaden the labor pool. The real constraint there was felt after the summer flying season when the hangar is still back up and the aircraft came back in, and we were out there looking for mechanics. We're well ahead of that exercise this year versus last year., And so far, we've been able to do that on a relatively consistent cost base. We had, had to make some targeted increases at certain levels within the organization based on experience and trying to get certain people into the organization, but nothing at this point that would materially impact the margins. Having said that, that is a trend in terms of the tightness of the labor supply and it's something that we're monitoring closely which is why I wanted to bring it up., No. It's not an SG&A. Those are direct..., ...labor costs – right, right., Sure., Hi, Josh., So, we're on the IDIQ. And we're one of three large contractors on the IDIQ. There were also – there's also a small business in that component. So, there were three smaller contractors. And the value of the IDIQ is up to $25 billion over its 10-year period. And what will happen next is task orders will come out where we bid separately. And as each one of those task orders comes out, we'll compete against the other contractors that are on the IDIQ for that past quarter., So, the first step is getting on the IDIQ to have the ability to bid on the task order. The next step is winning the task order themselves. And at this point, we don't have visibility into the size or duration or the scope of the individual task orders. Obviously, with a $25 billion ceiling, it's pretty significant opportunity. But we do have to compete to win – further to win actual work on that contract., In general, I think there are certain asset classes that are in higher demand than others. We see pockets of demand for certain asset classes based on fleet movement, and we're getting ahead of that demand by going out and securing certain assets. I don't want to get into specifics, obviously, for competitive reasons, but suffice to say that both in the engine and airframe market, the trading business continues to look good, but the key is going out there and being able to get your hands on the right material., Sure., Hi, Ken., Sure, Ken, it's John. I wouldn't describe the ramp as slower. I would describe it as more compressed. In other words, when the original task order associated with the $50 million was put out, there were some assumptions made that certain functions would be taken over by AAR over time. The way state has worked with us and laid it out, those functions are really all going to be taken over in a very short period of time at the end of the transition period. And once those are taken over, we go live officially on the whole program on May 1. And at that point, we expect to be at full run rate, which is consistent with the numbers we've presented in January., Sure. Thanks. This is John again. Really, the growth in the parts businesses has been across the board, both in the trading, on the engine and airframe side, as well as in distribution across multiple of our distributorship lines. And in distribution, that covers both the commercial and government markets. So we've really seen increased demand all over., There's a couple of new programs that we have signed in those businesses that we expect to continue to ramp over the next several quarters, so we remain confident right now about the continued growth in those businesses., Hey, Rob., Yeah. So we don't have a sale, per se, at this moment, but we will be putting the businesses up for sale. And the contracts that are associated with that business are no longer reflected in our sales numbers., Yes. Correct., We're seeing good growth in our businesses and we feel good about the prospects for hitting those targets that we espoused., So, the revenues are – we feel that we can pick up the revenues through the growth of our other businesses. And the contribution margin from the business that we are looking to sell has been negligible., Yeah. We have been – Rob, so to be clear, we have been transitioning our interest and our energy around this new contract, which is obviously a very meaningful piece of business for the company. And we're eager to commence work on this contract and have gone ahead and reallocated our resources to make certain that we're successful in this regard. So that's..., ...that's what you're seeing here., You're asking what the – you're asking in relationship to the expectations that we established at the Investor Day and..., ... what we're saying is yes to your question about should we expect more profits last year, I think you can see by the numbers that we're putting out there that we'll be significantly more profitable next year., Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. Rob, the answer is that we will be much more profitable next year than we are this year. And we are forecasting that, we've communicated that, and that's what we're expecting., I think John answered that question. I think we've had consistent growth across all of the businesses in that segment., Yeah. I think that's a – I think that's fair to say, yes, Larry., I think that's a good way to look at it, yes., Slightly less than $3 million of INL and mobility. That's correct., Yes. In both regards, the answer is yes. More so in INL, but, yes, increased expenses in preparation for INL/A., No. I won't say dilutive, but I won't say it was – it was not additive., Yeah., For which period are you referring to? Because the business went through a steady decline, if you will. So which period would you like us to address?, 
            , We'd like to discuss that offline., Yeah. So keep in mind in the earnings guidance we're giving you a range, okay? You've got a range in that regard. So I would say this action strengthens our confidence, let's say, in the potentially higher end of the range., Yeah, sure. It's something that has been going on now for some time, and this is certainly an industry dynamic, not just an AAR dynamic. And, right, so we have a number of recruiting initiatives going on. We have internal training initiatives where we're taking some of our more experienced workforce from certain sites to import to other sites to train up newly minted technicians., And then on the wage side, there are certain levels in the organization where we are looking at compensation adjustments. And then on a broader sense, we are already in dialogue with certain of our customers about potentially having to adjust pricing as a result of the wage pressures. And the customers are very aware of this., Yeah. We've started the conversations and they all understand the dynamic. And we're a very important provider to them and an important part of the supply chain, and they want to make sure that we're successful., We do. I think we're in the exact same position in that regard as we were at the Investor Day. The only thing that really changed, as I mentioned, was the timing of certain events during the transition period., Can you repeat the question, Ben, because you..., 
            , Well, the business, although it's up on a year-over-year basis, it is not approaching historical levels at this time. In terms of the fixed cost to support that business, as that business does continue to see growth, we don't expect much in the way of additional costs. So, as this business receives contracts, it is a pretty profitable activity for the – it's a very profitable activity for the company., Yeah. Go ahead., Yes. Yes., Yeah. Late in 2019 or in fiscal 2019 is when we anticipate being – inducting our first aircraft., Sorry, go ahead., Sure. So at the narrow-body facility, we're in negotiations with two different baseload customers. We would have between four and six lines of narrow-body maintenance. Currently, those customers are sending their work out of the country, so they're interested in bringing that work back in the country to bring jobs to India., We hope they'd be in the position to announce those contracts here relatively soon. And there's two phases of the facility planned. The first investment phase is one hangar that, like I said, can take up to six narrow-body lines. The second phase would be a similar sized hangar that would be able to take another four to six lines on the same side. But we've secured lands to be able to construct both facilities. And just to go back, we do expect to be able to induct our first aircraft in the middle of FY 2019., Thanks, Ben., Thanks, Ben."
1004,2019.0,Q&A,a,"Hey, Rob. How are you doing?, Thank you., Yeah. Well, again, we're real proud of the first half. It's been a great start to the year and as we think about the second half, you do come up against tougher comps versus last year because that was about when we started to see some recovery in the MRO business, so that drives a bit of it., You did mention Expeditionary Services. Sean mentioned we are expecting a recovery in the second half, although it will likely be below the plan that we originally developed when we presented the guidance originally. But overall, we're happy that we're in a position to have raised the guidance overall for the year and this represents the best view of the opportunities that we see at this time., So Expeditionary – right now, we're focused, as we said, on improving the performance of that business and part of what happened this quarter was situational. We had some operational issues that we've worked through and then we've also seen some awards get delayed from the government, and we expect those to come through during the second half of the year., Depending on when those hit obviously will drive the performance in the second half of the year but as we've talked, Rob, for a long time, our focus as a company generally speaking has been growing and building out the Aviation Services segment. And that's where the investment, that's where the focus has been and that's where you've seen the growth. So that's the long-term future of the company., That is a great question and I like our answer. There is nothing like that in the market. It's the only application that gives you the type of visibility that we do into the component repair supply chain and it also allows customers to share data. We need more customers to get on the platform and share their data with us. But in an anonymized way, on an individual component level, customers can now compare the price that they're paying against the community, and that's a feature that we're seeing a great deal of interest in. So, I mean, from a financial standpoint, it's a very small contributor to the overall results right now, but it's our first foray into an actual software program and we're really excited that Alaska is onboard., Well, yeah. We definitely have technical partners that help us develop the platform but those are more kind of on a consulting basis as opposed to any significant commercial relationship. And we have a number of technical partners that are helping us build out the rest of the digital solutions and as I mentioned, we're seeing a really significant increase of revenue through the digital channels that we've developed for our traditional businesses over the last couple years., Thanks, Rob., Hey, Ken., Sure. As we think about gross profit, there were some – the positives are continued exceptional performance out of the parts businesses and the recovering MRO. The two areas that were offsetting to that, as Sean mentioned, one was, as you mentioned, government programs., Now, we don't see headwind in government programs. We actually see a great deal of growth and very strong performance out of that area of the company, but the way those work, they're dilutive to the gross profit number, but accretive to our operating margin. So that mix there is a pretty meaningful impact this quarter and we would expect it to be an impact going forward given the growth of that business., On commercial programs, we've talked the last several quarters about the market there and we have seen increased competition and the pricing has been driven down as a result for that market. We continue to compete, but as we've talked about, we have certain return requirements. If we can't meet those return requirements, we're not going to take the deal., On existing contracts, we have seen some cost headwinds uncertain of the contract. As Sean mentioned, we're working to address those. Some of that, though, is timing and situational that you saw in this quarter and that's because in certain of the contracts, in order to improve operational performance, we accelerated the WIP and so that had the effect of pulling costs forward, which we saw in this quarter., And also because of the accounting changes that took place last year, a number of these contracts are now on a cash basis as opposed to managed over time. So you do see , It's all of the above. Very strong performance out of trading, very healthy year-over-year growth there, continued strong performance from the new parts business, very nice growth out of the government programs area. Those contracts have matured and as you pointed out, the recovery in the MRO business is meaningful as well., Sure, sure. A couple thoughts there. Yes, you should expect to see continued growth out of that government services business and we have a very full pipeline. And the point that we made on past performance is the more we win, the more we're able to win because we build more experience, which allows us to bid on more types of work. So that is widening the aperture of the types of things that we can pursue., On top of that, we've really successfully made the migration from a subcontractor to a prime contractor over the last four or five years and that again is helping us bid these larger programs. And we're also taking advantage of the fact that we just won, as you know, two quarters ago, the C-40 contract to sell two aftermarket aircraft to the government. And that is a great example of the government accessing the aftermarket., And on that, the original solicitation that came out for those two aircraft was originally written for only the purchase of two new aircraft. And we worked in DC to allow that solicitation, to allow the sourcing of two used aircraft and ultimately, we're successful in winning that. That, we believe, is going to open up more doors for us, not just for used aircraft sales, but for also used part sales. And we see a lot of opportunity coming there., I was just at a DoD Maintenance Symposium. I gave a keynote speech last week there and we talked a lot about the DoD making better use of well-established aftermarket solutions as it looks to go ahead and increase the sustainment and the readiness of the fleet but doing that in a more cost-effective way. And there was a lot of interest as we gave these commercial examples of – and their applications to the government environment. So we remain very excited about the growth prospects for us in government services., Thanks, Ken., Hey. Thanks, Mike., Yeah. GoDirect, yeah., Sure. There's a handful of digital initiative that we've got. Some are external and some are internal. Quickly in the internal, we've done a lot of work to put more information and take advantage of data that we collect from our heavy maintenance activities and our Power-by-the-Hour activities and our parts sales activities and use that data to get more information in front of our employees real-time so that we can capture sales more quickly., From an external standpoint, we do have our parts store. We're seeing a lot of traffic through that store. We've seen very, very healthy month-over-month increases of traffic through that store and we've seen a broader acceptance of small and large customers in terms of transacting business digitally as opposed to phones and emails. So we're excited about that., I wouldn't want to necessarily compare us to – there's a lot of people out there. As you mentioned, there's Honeywell GoDirect, there is ePlane, there is AeroBuy. There's all kinds of different platforms out there. One of the reasons we are successful is because this is what we do. This is a core business for us and we're taking what we do and what we do very, very well and applying it to a digital channel. So I remain very excited about what we're seeing there., Yeah. I mean net-net, the MAX is a positive for us and we've said before that it's neutral to slightly positive right now, but it's definitely positive over the long term because it extends the life of the current generation platforms. As it relates to material availability, there's no question 737 material is very, very tight, but we are the best in the world at sourcing that material and sourcing it at the right price. As a matter of fact, we just closed on two aircraft actually recently and we're really happy that we made that buy and we're able to get our hands on that because that's great material that will help us in the second half., So, the fact that we are – we're the largest in the world for this. We've got the best network of buyers and the sourcing team around the world and we've got the balance sheet capacity and flexibility to close faster than anybody we compete with. That's giving us an edge in that market. On top of that, we also have the best set of contracts, particularly with the engine shops for long-term supply agreements, so when we go out and we find the right material, we've got the capital to deploy quickly and we know we've got it sold because we've got contracts., Well, I would say just on parts trading, I mean we expect this heightened level of activity to continue for a long time. And that was well before the MAX grounding happened because of the contracts that we have, the forecast we see from the shop and the bow wave of maintenance visits that's expected to occur over the next couple of years. So, we feel very good about that business and the continued strength for many quarters to come., In terms of overall margin, it's a big focus of ours. We are focused on improving that number. MRO is not yet back at the level that it was two years ago. We're headed that way. Each quarter, we make a little bit of improvement, but that is still depressed from where it was a couple of years ago because our labor cost increased and we have not yet passed that entire cost onto the customer. The customers are being very supportive. They've got their own cost pressures and they're working with us, but we still have some work to do there., On top of that, we did bring in a lot of new talent and that talent takes a while to get trained and get good at what they do and ultimately become more efficient on the floor. And as that happens, we expect to see continued margin improvement in MRO., And then, as Sean mentioned on the commercial programs front, there are definitely some cost challenges that we've seen recently there and we're taking a number of actions to address those. And if we work through that, we would expect to see margin improvement there, too., Thanks, Mike., Hey, Josh., We have been making continued investments in the inventory, so that investment has actually grown over the last few quarters. The turns have also improved, so we're seeing material come in and go out. But candidly, the demand is so significant that wherever we can find material, we get it and often we're able to move it very quickly. So, we have investment plans, et cetera, but those investment plans have to be flexible when we come across opportunities to get our hands on the right stuff., I'm sorry. On what exactly?, Oh, SaaS., Okay., Yeah. I would characterize that as very, very early, very early. So we've got a launch customer. We have multiple other customers that we're talking about right now and I would say, to use your words, we are in the phase of a price discovery., Well, for us, we are up year-over-year. We're sold out through the rest of the year and we have seen customers move work around largely as result of scheduled changes due to the MAX but we, from our standpoint, we're at a very high utilization., And I would say our utilization last year was constrained by labor rather than pure capacity and so our labor position is better. So we're at a higher utilization but the constraint continues to be labor overall in that market., I think that's a good point. The macro environment for labor has not improved year-over-year. It's our position within that environment, thanks to the actions that we've taken, have allowed us to make this recovery., Waiting for the MAX question. It's a great question, actually. I mean, clearly right now, we really haven't seen a whole lot obviously as the MAX continues to incur delays. Operators have been looking to continue to support Airlift. So that could keep some of the current Boeing 787-700s, Boeing 787-800s, Boeing 787-900s still flying, which would create maintenance events, whether through the MRO or through engine, but I mean currently today, if it's anything, it's actually opened up some slots for us in the engine world, which would be great, because we've been able to see some engines in, get them repaired and continue to support the existing fleet, but it's – currently at this point in time, we don't see anything over the next few months that's really going to change much, but truly if it does continue on into next year for a while, I think it will help out our business in some ways., We have some internal goals that I wouldn't necessarily share at this point. However, we do see them accelerating the growth of all of the businesses that we're in. We have internal targets as it relates to the specific digital revenues, so, for example, revenue targets that we've set up for AIRvolution, for example, but driving commerce through PAARTS Store, some of the mobile applications that we're putting out, the efficiencies, Brian covered efficiencies of ways that we want to deploy technology inside in our hangers, all of that is going to improve the overall profitability and the growth of the company. So we've got internal targets, but we're excited about the possibilities that lie ahead there. Yeah, go ahead., Yeah. Sure, sure, it covers both commercial and government opportunities and these are contracts or RFPs that we would see available to us in both markets. The $10.2 billion is the summation of the total contract value of each one of those. So if you have a 10-year contract at $10 million a year, that's a $100 million deal that's loaded into this $10 billion number. The timeline most of these would be awarded within the next 12 to 18 months. On the government side in particular, the timeline is less certain, but these are either RFPs that are out that we're in the process of bidding on, again both in government and commercial or RFPs that we anticipate coming out based on what we hear in the market., Yeah. We assign a , Sure., Sure. Sure. I think it's a bit of both. I think it's growing with the market and capturing increased share. Certainly, if you look at the last four years, we've had a 10% revenue CAGR, so growing at a multiple of what the market has, a lot of that is coming from taking share. Particularly in the Integrated Solutions business, as Nick mentioned, those are large and growing markets. Those solutions are becoming more and more acceptable in the market and our ability to capture share from that large, growing market is increasing. Particularly on the government side, Nick touched on this. But we're the only company that is truly out there offering a commercial best practice against our traditional competitors in the government space. And as much as we grew up in the commercial world, we've faced different pressures with – going through cycles and customers that have gone bankrupt , Yeah. China and Southeast Asia. So as Chris mentioned, we're very proud of the fact that our commercial business, 40% of our revenue already is coming from overseas. We see that continuing to move closer to 50-50 over time. We are – we have sales offices, we have warehouse locations to support the parts businesses. We are looking for opportunities over time to find the right partners to facilitize Southeast Asia. We don't think it's necessarily a requirement because a lot of these parts, they're small, they can be shipped, but we do think that ultimately it will make sense to have a greater facility footprint in that region and certainly we took steps in that direction with the , Do you want to? Yeah., Yeah. Sure. So I think we already support some large domestic, well, domestic in Air Canada, Alaska and few other ones, but I think a lot of our growth over the course and John mentioned the growth that came from additional market penetration or market capture has been in our Commercial Programs business. So we've grown very fast over the last three years, we're rationalizing a little bit of our approach and trying to focus on a more scalable fleet type rather than trying to be everything to everyone. But I see a lot of growth potential across both our Commercial and our Government Programs businesses. It's a strategic area for us and we'll continue to focus on it., Great. Thanks again., Size of the market or size of our business?, Sure. We don't break down the size of the individual business units inside the segments and nor do we give the specific margin information, but in terms of growth, I'd start by saying that we see growth across all of the areas, going into parts supply, for example, you heard from Sal and Eric, we're coming off of several years of significant growth in both of those markets. And again, that's largely due to the dynamics that Sal described where you've got – we're very well-positioned given certain of the things that are happening with the next generation engine platforms. So that has been a significant growth area. I think we've mentioned this on the call last week. As we think about the year ahead for that business, we're forecasting a bit more normalized growth. Again, that's based on what we see today. But – and also driven by the fact that we're coming off of a year of significant growth. So the comps are tougher., On the distribution business, we've been able to outstrip there by taking share. As Eric described, we really believe we have a unique offering there. We're starting to gain a lot of traction in the market. Our neutrality as an independent is unique and we're seeing that take – really take it back with the OEMs. That's a step function growth though because these are – you've got multibillion dollar OEMs and for them to give us a $10 million, $20 million, $50 million a year contract, it's kind of an oh, by the way, decision for them, that's a step function change in our revenue. So we've got a great pipeline of opportunities there and as these thing hit and they do take time to ramp up, you'll see that business move and that's what we've seen over the last few years., On the program side, it's similar in as much as you do see step function changes there. Obviously last year, we went through a big step-up with the implementation of WASS, to a certain degree also with the landing gear PBL contract and we've seen, as Nick just described, kind of step function increases in our Commercial Programs business as well. Nick just touched on in the Commercial Programs business, we see that market growing. It's a very competitive market. That offering is very mature out there and it's very well understood by the customer base. So, while there is more and more opportunities, we're looking for ways to continue to be able to compete effectively, while achieving the return thresholds that we look for. And as Nick also mentioned, we were very focused on customized programs as we've gotten bigger and built a bigger pool, standardization across the way we operate as we become more important, and so we're rationalizing our offering and being a bit more selective in terms of the opportunities that we're going after. So, generally speaking for Commercial Programs, we see more growth because that market is growing, but we are very mindful of the increased competition out there., I think that's a great question and certainly the strategic focus is on the growth of the Aviation Services business. We like certain of the connections to composites and Brian touched on those. We like the government aspect of the Mobility business because we think overall, it's a hedge, but we're achieving that hedge in other ways to the growth of the Government Programs business. So, overall I see that again I would point to fewer businesses, more tightly connected, and we're talking about how those connections work within the Aviation Services segment., Yeah. Well, again, we're coming off of some very significant growth. We've been outgrowing the industry and I think as we've said, we see continued growth ahead of us and the guidance reflects the best view that we have of that growth for the next 12 months. So long term though, we still have a target, we feel very confident to get in that 5% to 10% growth range, which would be higher than the market. As it relates to margin improvement, hopefully you throughout the presentation that we have a number of different initiatives to improve the margin of the company, whether it's through investment in intellectual property, whether it's through some of these digital enhancements, certainly being more focused where we have a proprietary advantage, exclusive distribution relationships, exclusive supply relationships on the trading side, all of those are designed to improve our margins. And every deal we look at, so when I talk about that $10.2 billion pipeline, every one of those programs, the way we would bid it would be accretive to our current margin and ROIC position today., So the opportunities that we're looking at will improve our position. So again you've seen some improvement over the last couple years, and I think that's demonstrative of what is ahead of us. But we're only going to go after things that are going to be, like I said, accretive to where we are today., Generally speaking, I would say, it takes time. The programs take time to kick in. We certainly saw ramp-up of INL, ramp up of Landing Gear PBL. Eric's distribution agreements, it takes a while to establish those channels. But if we look and even in commercial programs, certain of those agreements, it takes a while to get going and get the parts flowing. So we've got a great history now of watching the way these programs ramp up. And if you look at the deals that we signed two, three, four, five years ago, they're really driving significant overall improvement in the margin. There are some businesses that are lagging and we're taking steps to address those. And Mike's question kind of highlighted on something that we might do there, as it relates to the portfolio. But again, I would just – I would highlight that any opportunity we're chasing would be margin accretive., So we're – as we mentioned, we're still in construction of the JV. The initial phase is essentially through lines of maintenance for narrow-bodies. So if you look at that as an initial starting place, we'll secure launch customer, we'll bring in , Yeah. So I would say, just to put a final point on that kind of, it started out at a few hundred thousand man hours for the capacity, it's a quadruple to that., Yeah., Any other questions? Hey, Larry., Yeah., Yeah, Yeah, No, no, no, good question, I don't have the number in front of me, maybe Sean. I mean, last year, we went from, I'd say, I think roughly 13% SG&A to 10.2%, yeah. So we are forecasting a little bit of an uptick going into this year, and the reasons for that are, you've highlighted a couple of them. Certainly, these digital initiatives, we don't capitalize all of that, so a lot of that is expensed. I mean, so that's driving a piece of it. We are enhancing our – just generally speaking, , So as the footprint that Eric and Sal approach gets larger, we talked about growth in Asia et cetera. We're adding more sales resources, and there's a ramp there too. You don't hire a sales force and they go out and start selling another $10 million of revenue a year. It takes a little while to get them integrated into market, et cetera. So we're making forward investments. This is a year of forward investments in that regard. And we are also beating up or adding – or enhancing our compliance across the company, and we're making some investments in there as well., No I wouldn't tie any of that to investments. When the K comes out, we can talk about specifically what they are. But they're very narrow in focus and we believe that we'll be able to remediate this very quickly., Yeah. From a – Sean, do you want to?, Yeah. I'll just add that, we talked about on our last week's call. We're not giving kind of a specific guidance on free cash flow. A part of that is because we talked about here that we have some significant opportunities to investment growth business, which I walked you kind of the capital allocation , Yeah. And I don't want to in anyway – cash flow and being a positive cash flow is extraordinarily important to us as a management team and is a big focus of ours this year. Again to Sean's point, we just want to give ourselves some space to make some of these investments that we potentially see in Eric and Sal's business, the mixed business in particular, right., I think long-term that would be a goal., Yeah., Hey, Mike., No. So, that tax benefit was not contemplated as part of the original $2.50 to $2.80 guidance., Sure. First of all, the contract's performing very well operationally. The customer is extremely happy. We're in regular contact with our counterparts at the State Department and they're very pleased with our performance. So, this new site will go live later in this quarter and will be fully up and running in the first quarter of FY 2020. And we have ranges on what the site will do as it relates to revenue. It's not as large as some of the other sites like Afghanistan, for example, but it will certainly be a positive impact to the program. And I think as we said in the last quarter, there are additional sites being contemplated, but this is the first one that's been definitized., Yeah., I am seeing that announcement. The protest is over. They ended up adding more participants to the IDIQ. There are, I believe, multiple task orders that are out to bid and we have a few bids in on those task orders and we expect to hear at this point any time., I'll get information on that Leidos award., Yeah. So, we go in and out of the market at – and I certainly appreciate the question – we go in and out of the market at various times during the year and one of those entry points, if you will, is January after the aircraft come back from the holiday flying season. And so, now that we're in the market and the aircrafts are in work, we have good visibility for the rest of FY 2019 because we don't have another entry and exit point, if you will, to the market. So, that's why we feel comfortable issuing the guidance., As it relates to quantifying the impact, it's significant and we tried to frame that for you just in terms of again, had we not had this labor headwind, we would have been well in that original guidance range that we issued back in January last year. So, it definitely has been a significant impact to the company., Yeah. I mean, again, we view INL as organic. It's a win. So, we view all the growth this quarter as organic growth, and for the first couple quarters of INL, we have broken that out just to give everybody a sense as to the ramp-up, but on a going forward basis, it's part of the company and so we're not going to be breaking that out. But it's contributing as expected., Yeah. No, a great question on the MAX. Certainly, we have a number of MAX customers around the world as you know. You mentioned flydubai, which is a program customer. The MAX grounding certainly depending on how long it lasts could really impact the company in a couple of ways. On the potential downside, it would mean that aircraft that we anticipate coming in for maintenance into our hangars that those could fly to the right because those aircraft have now been put into operation or extended their service to fulfill routes that previously had been operated by the MAX., Conversely, the fact that 737NGs, current generation 737NGs, current generation A320s might be flown more to make up for routes that previously had been served by the MAX. That's going to drive, likely depending on how this goes on, that's going to drive increased parts requirements and those are bread-and-butter fleets for us so that could be a positive. So, it's early. We're in active dialogue with all of our MAX customers and it's something we're watching very closely., Thanks, Ken., Hi, Rob., So, I guess – a great question – a couple of thoughts there. The receptivity of the customers as it relates to potential pricing changes in this issue has definitely improved significantly over the last couple quarters. And we have had some success with a couple of our major customers in repricing our agreements to account for higher labor costs on our end. However, there's a timing issue and this is a bit of a moving target., And one of the things we saw when we went back into the market in January is that rates that we felt good about that would attract labor in certain sites actually were not as attractive as we thought. And so, we were in a bit of a back and forth between what it took to get experienced technicians and what it takes to – and what we are able to get from the customer. So, that's an ongoing dialogue., And it's also not just a rate discussion. It's really about the experience of the labor force. So, we've been able to attract bodies, if you will, or good people, but they're just not as experienced and not as efficient as the labor force we would have had, say, a year ago. And so, that efficiency certainly plays a role in the profitability inside the operation as well., Yeah. India is still an ongoing project. We actually did make quite a bit of progress this past quarter. There were various issues that had slowed down the construction of the facility. We got through those. We're back on track now. We're still in an active dialogue with the launch customer and I still view that as a calendar 2019 go live event., Overall, it would be – it's a startup, right, so there'll be some startup costs that we'll incur once we get going. But ultimately, we view this as an accretive operation to the portfolio, given the price that we'll be able to charge over there relative to the cost of labor. And as we get closer and certainly as we're in a position to announce the launch customer, we can provide more information on all that., Yeah., If we go back to Q1 and Q2, we had broken that down a bit more and overall, we saw and we – because it's within the segment, we want to get away from that. But overall, we saw similar performance – similarly very strong performance in the parts supply businesses as we did in the first half of the year. So, if you go back and you look at what we had disclosed prior, we're kind of in that range. And we could see that continuing. I mean those businesses are doing extremely well at the moment and we're encouraged by all of the demand that we're seeing both in the aftermarket parts market and the new parts distribution market., MRO has declined from last year., So, we're working on that and we're writing our plan and we're starting to write our plan for FY 2020. And we will be having an Investor Day at the beginning of FY 2020 and at that point, we'll provide guidance for the full year. And one point, Rob, just as you think about Aviation Services and we'll talk more about this when we have our Investor Day, we view this as a bundled services offering. So, it's a big part of our value proposition and how we're driving growth in the market is the parts supply related to – our parts programs related to the MRO, we view all of those as working together to offer a bundled solution to the customer. And as you know, that model has been quite successful if you look at the growth in Aviation Services over the last several years., No, no, no, no, no. I don't see it as structural. I think you're exactly right. I think this is a moment in time in the market and we're in the process of finding a new equilibrium between the rates that we charge the customers and the rates that we have to pay in order to field a qualified team of mechanics., That's been the case this fiscal year., Yeah., Yeah, Larry, you've got that right. I mean it's coming from the labor businesses which are the hangars and mobility of the manufacturing. That's what's driving it., Exactly. I mean the overall growth of the company is still – we still have got mid-teens growth. And again, the programs businesses and the parts businesses continue to perform well above the expectations that we had., Yeah. That's correct. Several of the customers that we have contract with, their fleets will grow and so we'll see additional ramp on business that we've already won, and that's on the programs businesses. We've also, over the last couple of quarters, continued to sign a number of new parts distribution businesses with different OEMs and those are all in various stages of ramping up as well., And that's another area of the company, the new parts distribution area of the company which is contractual on the buy. In other words, we have long-term supply contracts with the OEMs, but in a lot of cases it's also contractual on the sell. In other words, we have long-term supply agreements locked up with the airline customers that we serve or the government customers that we serve. And so, that's a nice sustainable growth business that's more easy to forecast., Yeah. It will be a little below that this year. So, if you look at the last couple quarters that we did disclose, we were in the high-40s., Yeah. So, it'll be below the $200 million for this fiscal year. Yeah. Yeah., It's the fifth operating site, there's a program..., Yeah, we prefer not to get into that, but it will not be the largest site., Fair., Fair. That's fair., Yeah, not yet. We still have some assets that we're looking to sell. So, once that's all wrapped up, we'll disclose as announced., Yeah. Yeah, that's right., Yeah, 23%, 24% is what we think on the tax rate., Yeah., Yeah. On the government side, we've actually got a lot of good things going on in Japan. We do quite a lot of new parts distribution to the JMOD, the Japanese Ministry of Defense and we've got a – because of that, we have a growing footprint in Japan in terms of an office there. And we have had contracts with various Japanese commercial customers over the year, having the ability to issue tags on repair parts attendant to some of these other opportunities that we have in Japan is a positive., So, it's a target market for us. Historically, it's been a really good market for AAR. We saw some – it kind of went away from us in recent years, but we've had a renewed push and getting the JCAB approval is a good step in the right direction., Thanks, Larry., Hey, Ken., Yeah. I think that's a great question. It's important to note that as we've been going through this over the last few quarters, we have not lost a single customer. We have had work or lines of work that we have had to turn away at certain of our facilities because we just didn't have the labor to handle them, but the customers overall are sticking with us. And not only are they sticking with us, they're very supportive of AAR. We deliver a quality product. We're the largest in North America, as you know, and we are a vital part of this part of the aviation aftermarket support system., And so, the dialogue that we've been having is one around, okay, what do you think you need from us in order to field the team so that we can keep the work with you. And we've received a lot of support in that regard. In terms of where the work is going, there's a number of larger and smaller MROs in North America that work has been kind of moved around based on things that we've had to turn down depending on where we were in the labor retention area. But the customers are supportive. And it's also important to note that we've got – we do have long-term contracts in place with most of our larger MRO customers. And so we've got mechanisms to keep the work., That's correct., Yeah., Sure., Hey, it's Sean. I think we expect – and Q4, as you mentioned, is usually a pretty strong quarter for cash flow. So, I think we would expect continued strong cash flow growth in Q4. But as it relates to kind of the full year and that 50% EBITDA target, that's not something that we think we're going to be in, but we think we'll be cash flow positive for the year as we've mentioned previously., Hey, Rob. How are you?, Yeah, that's correct. The C-40 is in Aviation Services. And Expeditionary, we saw margin compression year-over-year, primarily due to product mix than what was shipped in the quarter. We also saw an increase in raw material costs for our manufacturing business up in mobility and that had an adverse impact on the margins in that business., Yeah. I think we haven't gone into the specifics on that, but I think for the balance of the year, we would expect some recovery in the margins. And then in the back end of the year to have kind of a strong year and get back to where it was closer to last year., Yeah, sure. So the growth came from a lot of areas in the company, and again, we're really excited about the strong start to the year. Parts supply, as we talked about in the last several quarters, has really performed exceptionally well. And that's both parts supply in the aftermarket business, the trading business, as well as parts supply in the new parts business, the distribution business. And..., ...we've announced a number of contracts including two that we just referenced with Mitsubishi, as well as with Leach, in those businesses, new and aftermarket parts. We've announced a number of contracts over the last several quarters. And so, those contracts, they take a little while to ramp up, but once they do, they really contribute. So, that's been driving a lot of growth., Also in the quarter, we had a very nice improvement in our MRO business. Last year, if you recall, our summer was particularly slow, which led to a number of issues that we then felt throughout the year as we look to go back into the labor markets to get technicians back on board. We had a very nice recovery in this summer. And that was a real nice contributor to the growth., And that also sets us up well for the balance of the year, because if we think about where we were a year ago at this point in time, we were in the market recruiting for lots of technicians because we're coming off of the soft summer. Given the fact that we've had a stronger summer, our demands for technicians at this point are much less than they were a year ago. So we're set up well there. And then as Sean mentioned, the C-40 win, we're in early days of that contract, and it's not – we don't have a full picture yet on how that revenue will pace quarter-to-quarter throughout the next two years. But as Sean said, we recognized about $18 million in the quarter this quarter, and that obviously contributed to the revenue growth as well., No, I wouldn't – we don't want to get into specific growth of the specific operating units. But parts supply is not growing off of a small base., It's not. No, it's a meaningful base. And it's been meaningful growth on a meaningful base for several quarters now., Yeah. Again, I don't think we want to get into details on that element of it. But I would reiterate that we saw a very nice recovery in MRO, and we continue to see parts supply, both new and aftermarket, do extremely well., Yeah., It does, and we'll note that we did see – as Sean mentioned, we did see a nice improvement in cash flow. We were still consumers of cash this quarter. We consumed about $30 million of cash. But if you take out the impact of the accounts receivable securitization, that's a $20 million improvement over last year. Seasonally, we do see cash consumption in the first quarter largely as a result of MRO, but we are very focused on cash generation, and we expect to see improved cash generation as we move throughout the year, similar to what we did last year. But again, relative to guidance, we want to give ourselves the space. The demand for parts in the aftermarket is extremely strong right now. And one of our most significant differentiators is our ability to move quickly and close on large buys of material. And so we want to give ourselves the flexibility to do that., And then your point on distribution is right on. When you win these distribution contracts, typically there is an upfront buyer material and that cash goes out, and as I said before, it does take a little while for those programs to ramp up, but once they do, they become nice contributors to margin as well as turn cash flow positive., Great. Thanks, Rob., Hey, Joe. How are you?, Well, I think we've done a nice job in de-risking, and I think your points are right on. The macro environment has not improved for what we do, but we've been, as we talked about throughout last year, very aggressive in terms of the kinds of things that we're doing to get out ahead of labor market. And a lot of that is developing proprietary relationships with tech schools, et cetera, so that we can develop our own pipeline of talent. And that is working. There's an additional ramp-up there because that allows you to get fresh talent in the door and we're seeing some success there, which contributed to the results this quarter and will contribute throughout the year., But with that fresh talent, there is a bit of a learning curve when you get them in. And that learning curve translates to increased productivity in the hangar. So, we've got a good team kind of in place. We're definitely in the market now because we will have more demand in the second quarter versus the first quarter as we do every year. So we're in the market right now recruiting for talent. But once we get through this quarter, we'll have largely the team in place that we'll need for the year to handle the workload that we have., As it relates to growth next year, we do have floor space, so we have, in a few of our facilities, we do have floor space available and to the extent that we have demand for customers. And I should mention that we're extremely proud of our customer base in MRO. We've got a blue chip customer base. They're extremely supportive of us. They recognize the value of the service that we provide. They worked very closely with us throughout the summer to keep us fuller in the hangars than they did last year, so that we wouldn't have the labor challenges in the rest of the year as we saw last year., And a lot of them that did that are actually MAX operators. So even though they were under significant pressure to have their fleet working harder, they were still able to support us by keeping us fuller during the summer when they needed the aircraft. So thinking about next year, to the extent that we see demand for the customer base that we have, and we can layer in additional lines of maintenance, we're certainly going to continue to extend these recruiting techniques that have been working to meet additional demand in the hangars that we have available floor space., Yeah. So I would say that the pipeline – and we gave some numbers on that back in July at the Investor Day, I would say that that pipeline is as strong as it was when we talked about it back in Investor Day. And there are definitely meaningful opportunities out there, particularly on the government side that could have positive impacts in the way that C-40 will. But the challenge for the government business is it's difficult to predict when those are going to occur. So, to say that we've got opportunities in the near term, yes, there are plenty that could hit any time now. There are bids that have been out there for a while, but it's difficult to predict when those will happen., Yes. I'd say the pipeline continued to be pretty active but consistent with what it's been at least the last couple quarters. There's some assets in market, there's some assets that we think are interesting that could be coming to market. And I'd say the split's pretty balanced between commercial and government. I think we see the opportunity to add to both parts of our business. And as we have talked about at the Investor Day, we're really looking to add IP to the business, whether it be in kind of the parts supply distribution business or enhancing some capabilities on the government side. So I'd say it's active and pretty well-balanced across the portfolio., Great. Thanks., Hey, Ken., Yes, yes and yes. And as it relates to inflection, it was a – there's a big improvement in the first quarter versus last quarter, and that improvement is not only important as it relates to the results for the quarter itself, but as I mentioned earlier, it sets us up well for the rest of the year. Being able to maintain that team throughout the summer and being in the market now – we're still in the market for mechanics as we enter the busy season here, but we're in the market for a lot fewer than we were last year. So we're at an important time right now as we go out there and recruit. We're very encouraged by the results that we're seeing even as we start the second quarter. And, yeah, I think we're off to a very good start., Yeah. I think that's a great question and we're certainly thinking about that dynamic. I think, overall, we would characterize it as a net positive, because today there is – particularly on the aftermarket parts supply around engines, there is considerably more demand and more demand forecasted for the next several years for current-generation Boeing 737 shop visits. And to the extent that we're able to get more material, and we will be able to get more material as we see more retirements in that fleet, we've got demand for it. And we're the largest in the world for that market. We've got, as we keep saying, tremendous balance sheet capacity which we're excited about and want to maintain. And our goal would be to be in a position where we can move quickly as the material becomes available, and we've got outlets for that material., So, that's the biggest driver of all of this. Our heavy maintenance contracts for that fleet, they're longer term and they carry us several years out. So we feel good about the planned maintenance visits there. But generally speaking, I would say that we view that as a net positive., Yeah. I wouldn't want to get – and you got it, I wouldn't want to get too specific just for competitive reasons. But given the tightness of availability of material on the market, you definitely have had some pricing favorability out there. And you've also seen that in terms of the price that you pay for assets. And that again is where we believe we excel is our ability to find material, make the buy right, which often comes down to speed of being able to close transactions, and then command the best price and availability that you can in the market., So, in terms of trends, we've seen that over the last several quarters. This quarter in particular, I don't know that we saw necessarily any sort of meaningful change from where we were in , Yeah, I don't know that we want to get into that specific, but what I can tell you is that it's been a focus of ours to increase the amount of business under contract in the trading business. And so that's a much greater percentage of that business than it was a few years ago. But I wouldn't want to get into specifics there., Great. Thanks, Ken., Hey, Mike., Oh, great. Thanks., Yeah. We don't have a strong view on that at the moment. For the contracts that we are on and for the contracts that we have planned, are bidding, none of that would have an impact to anything that we're looking at. What we can say is that we think that AAR solutions for the government – and the C-40 is really an outstanding example of this – if the government is looking to save money going after solutions like what we just offer with the C-40 is a wonderful opportunity for them, and as we mentioned, that's a situation where the government came out, they wanted to buy two aircrafts, they were planning to buy a new aircraft, AAR was able to present a solution that allowed them to buy used aircraft and actually get those delivered sooner than they would have if they had bought new aircraft for considerably less. And you can bet that we're going to take that example and market it all over the place to the US government. It's an opportunity for them to save money, and not just in whole aircraft purchases and we believe that there's more out there like this, but also as it relates to just used serviceable material as a source of savings in all areas of procurement. So that's a big part of our strategy., That's a great question. It was not offered in this particular case, but I will point out that we do have another C-40 contract with the Navy, where we perform the maintenance and certain supply chain services as well. So while it wasn't part of this transaction, it's something that we've done successfully elsewhere., Yes, I would. I would., We certainly are keeping our eye on that and the credit worthiness of our customers, and obviously there's been some news just in the last few days in a couple of airlines. So that's definitely something we're focused on. I am in touch with our customers almost every day, and often at very senior levels, and while they're seeing – and I'm thinking about North America in particular – while they're definitely seeing pressure in certain areas, their businesses are still historically extremely strong, and the day-to-day demand both for parts and for maintenance out of the customers is also very strong., Coming back to your point, I do think, yes, as our customers look for more cost-effective solutions versus buying from OEMs or other suppliers, the aftermarket solutions that AAR offers represent a great opportunity to get quality products and services at better cost., Yeah, again, great question. There's a few firsts with this deal, most notably, this is actually the first where we are distributing parts that will be used in new OEM manufacturing. So, we kind of moved one step up in the supply chain here, where we're distributing parts that will actually be where the customer base is not end users like the airlines or the government; the customer base is, actually, in this case, the majority of the customer base is going to be OEMs that use the parts in their own manufacturing process. So, that opens doors for us and we're excited about that. We've already started ramping up nicely on that contract. And it should bring with it other opportunities as well., Well, I certainly would hope so. TransDigm, as you know with their operating model, they are fairly decentralized. So, the subsidiaries make their own decisions. But certainly we're focused on being successful with the contract we just signed with Leach, and we would do the best we can to leverage that success with other companies like Leach and certainly other companies within the TransDigm Group., No. So we didn't give adjusted EBITDA guidance for this year. Guidance for the year is sales, EPS, and we gave some color on SG&A and tax., Okay. All right. Thank you., Yeah. So the 10.5% would exclude any of those kind of compliance and investigation costs., Thanks, Rob., Hey, Rob. How are you?, Yeah, sure. Just on the quarter, thanks, we're really happy with the way the year ended, very strong results from the businesses across the company. As it relates to Expeditionary Services, we've announced a few wins in the mobility business throughout the year, and we're starting to perform on those wins and produce and ship products. So, we saw the benefit of that in Q4, and in ensuing quarters, we expect to see additional benefit as we ship off against those wins., Thinking about the year ahead, MRO, as I mentioned, we expect a partial recovery. We're encouraged by the results that we're seeing both in terms of the labor attraction and retention as a result of the initiatives that we implemented throughout the year, and we also feel good about the loading in the hangars heading into this year as well. And you're right. I mean, as you think about the growth rate at the midpoint of 5%, certain businesses are above that, certain businesses are below that, but that represents our best view of the blended rate from where we sit today., Yeah. Our India JV, I think we indicated last quarter that we expected construction to be complete this calendar year. Based on what we know right now, we still look for that. We're working to finalize the agreement with the customer, and once all that's done, we'll be able to give more color on how that will play into the results., No. We're not anticipating any., Yes. It is a little higher than we anticipated. As it relates to the matter that Sean mentioned in the 8-K, we haven't factored in costs there, although we did see some costs that came through in the fourth quarter. The 10.5% is really based on investments that we're making around sales resources to promote the continued growth, particularly in the parts businesses. And then we are adding some IT resources, we're making a number of investments around the digital space, and we saw some nice returns from those investments in FY 2019, so we want to continue to fund that growth, and then additional quality and compliance resources as well., Yeah. We do expect for this upcoming year to have a nice cash flow year, to be cash flow positive, but we're not giving any specific guidance as it relates to either free cash flow or operating cash flow for this upcoming year., I'd say just the part of our business, if we're going to – if we see opportunity, which we think we'll continue to do so, to invest to either support parts supply in inventory or new business wins in distribution or other programs, we're going to do that. And so we don't want to limit our ability to grow the business by boxing our self in on cash flow., We're not providing any guidance on cash flow., Other than to say we expect to be cash flow positive this year., Yes., Yeah., Right., Yeah. That's a fair range. Yes., It was down year-over-year, but we did see sequential improvement., Yeah. That's correct. That's correct., Yeah, I think you hit on it. A couple moving parts there, one is labor, and we highlighted that in the third quarter and that continues to be an element impacting the results there going forward. And then also, there is a mix issue there as it relates to the margin on different product lines, and certain of those where we won and are producing are lower-margin product that you might – we might have otherwise seen., Yeah. That's correct., Yeah, good question. We are expecting similar performance in FY 2020 to what we saw in FY 2019, and as we've been on the program now, we've learned more about how it operates, and we added a new site, we anticipate adding more sites. But new sites does not necessarily correlate with growth of the program, as you do have some up and downs between sites throughout the year., Again, if you look historically, still the program is at historical low from where it was a few years ago. And so we believe that there's potential for the program to grow from where it is. But as we look out over the next 12 months, just based on what we see, we expect it to be consistent with the prior 12 months., Yeah, I mean, based on some investments that we're making, that's what's driving the 10.5% that we're forecasting for this year, but it is still..., ...a long-term goal to get to the 10% or below level. And we did make meaningful progress. So if you look at where we were last year to this year, we made some really nice progress towards that long term 10% goal, but given some of these resources that we want to bring on during the year, that puts us at the 10.5% estimate now., Yeah. To the extent we see legal expenses related to the item in the 8-K, we would – we'll call that out., There was – there were expenses related to that in Q4., Correct., It's left in there, we did not call it out., Yeah. We want to see how it goes, but..., ...likely we'll highlight that., Hey, Ken., Hi, Ken., I think it's the latter. We had – as we've highlighted throughout the year, we had really substantial growth throughout FY 2019 in both the trading business as well as the new parts distribution business, and we're very pleased with that. We anticipate more growth in both of those business, and we're really happy with our market position in each one of those. But you're absolutely right. You get up against some pretty significant comps as you go throughout the year., I think that's a great question. And I think you highlighted the two most important elements there. Retirements are down in certain areas, the material availability is tight, but you're able to make up for that in price. And we have a market-leading position in the aftermarket parts business, and our team has done an exceptional job over the last several quarters dealing with that tight market and really outmaneuvering our competition to get our hands on the best material when it becomes available. And that's come through in the results. And we feel very good about our position there. We feel very good about the availability of material that we believe we'll be able to get our hands on versus our competitors, and really, I think our ground game is a lot better there, and even in a tight market, we're able to get the best stuff and sell it at a premium., Yeah., Yeah. I think as you highlight, we feel good about the balance sheet and where it is, and it gives us flexibility to invest. I think priority number one, we're going to continue to invest in the business, to grow the business that we have. But as it relates to capital allocation after that, you saw some increased repurchase activity in Q4. I think given the balance sheet and cash flow, we'll continue to look to deploy capital that way to return capital to shareholders. And on M&A, we will – we do see some opportunities out there and some ability for us to add to our portfolio, and we're going to look to do that over the next year or so., Yeah. We got about $230 million left on the buyback, on the current authorization., How are you?, Yeah. You're absolutely right, I mean, there is a cycle. The MRO business, and we've talked about this historically, is a single-digit-margin business. And it ranges from very low single digits to high single digits, but we've definitely seen that. I would characterize us right now at the low end of that range. We did a lot in FY 2019 to improve that situation both in terms of getting more price from the customer, as well as launching a whole series of different recruiting efforts and partnerships with schools to develop our own proprietary pipeline of talent. And we're starting to see the benefits of those now., And we've got a market-leading position in MRO, we've got a blue chip customer base, we've got great facilities, and we've got very supportive customers. And everybody in the industry is aware of this tightness of mechanics. And so as I said in the prepared remarks, we're getting a lot of support as it relates to pricing to help deal with the tightness in supply. So I'm encouraged by the progress that we made in FY 2019. I'm encouraged by the sequential improvements that we saw in the fourth quarter. I'm encouraged by the loading in the hangars that we have going into this summer versus where we were a year ago. And so all of those are positive things., So, again, getting back to your original question about the cycle, while we're at the low end, these are all favorable results from the initiatives that we started over the last 12 months to move us back to the higher end of the range., We're looking at a number of different things there, more specifically about our own footprint and rationalizing the workforce across that footprint. And as we noted in the prepared remarks, we took some steps during the first quarter to do that, and we're seeing the benefit of those things now. But as it relates to M&A, we're always open to ideas, and we will continue to look at creative solutions to deal with the overall labor challenge., Yeah. For competitive reasons, I wouldn't disclose a specific bid that we have out there. But what I will say is that there are some significant bids out there, both that have already been submitted and also those that are in the works. I think it's important to note that in the guidance, while we have a very strong pipeline of government opportunities, these deals take a long time to award, and we are anticipating that even if we see some significant awards during the year, it's likely that implementation wouldn't occur to have a meaningful impact on the FY 2020 results. And we could talk a little bit more about the pipeline and the type of things that we're looking at at the Investor Day next week., Thank you., Yeah, thanks, Mike., It's – actually it's a recompete. So we're on that contract today. So we..., ...successfully competed to retain that contract., And we have that – yeah, so we have that, and we are confident on our ability to retain it and so that's included in the guidance., Yeah. Yeah, I'd say, no major shift in kind of how we came about guidance in terms of the planning of the organization and budgeting process for the year. Obviously we're giving guidance at a different point in the fiscal year than the previous guidance. So, I think that allows us to have a little bit more insight into what we're seeing over the next 12 months, rather than an 18-month period. But other than that, I think largely consistent with how the company has thought about creating its plan and budget and communicating to the Street., Yeah. I think overall, and I think about our most transactional businesses where we're in day-to-day contact with the customer, notwithstanding the macro factors that you mentioned, the pace of activity that we're seeing on a day-to-day basis is as robust as we've ever seen. And that's – but that's enhanced by what I said earlier about our market position and the fact that we're able to get material that others cannot., And as it relates to the MAX, we talked about that in the third quarter, and we've seen some shifting in the MRO schedule as a result of the MAX, and we have seen a slight, I'd say, increase in parts demand as a result of the MAX. But nothing that really influenced the results, at least in the fourth quarter, but certainly that's something that we're monitoring closely., Yeah. We have., We have been able to renegotiate that – not – we have not been able to pass dollar-for-dollar, but we have been able to get some relief., Yeah. The customers are being , All right. Thank you."
1004,2020.0,Q&A,a,"Hey, Rob., Yeah. Sure, good question. So, from a parts standpoint, we felt the decline very early in the quarter. And I think the levels that we're at now which are again better than what we expected have been holding in the last several weeks. And given the dynamic in the environment, it's difficult to call anything a trough. But we saw a decline, and they have been holding steady for the last several weeks., Now, obviously, there is a lot of movement out there particularly with the North American carriers in terms of the results of the recent surge and changes they may be making to their fleets. But so far, the last several weeks, the parts businesses, both distribution and trading, have held in there., For MRO, throughout the quarter, we started the quarter with full hangars. And then throughout the quarter, as we delivered aircraft, in many cases, those aircraft were not replaced by an additional aircraft. So, we did see decline through the quarter. We are at a depressed level heading into the summer from where we would normally be. But seasonally, it's typically a low quarter for us., As it relates to MRO, we have a lot of dialogue with the customers right now about what the fall is going to look like. And I would say that's a very dynamic discussion. We're not yet clear on what the fall maintenance schedule will be. But we're confident that the customers are focused on keeping our facilities as full as possible because they want to make sure that they're available to them as they see a recovery., Yeah., We haven't seen that translate yet, but we do expect that there is a backlog of maintenance requirements that's building out there. And as the airlines look to manage their cash, we expect those maintenance events to convert. We do view that though with respect to potential retirements and the introduction of new aircraft into the fleet and I think those dynamics are still playing out., Yeah. So, haven't seen a tremendous amount of activity there. It's certainly – that's something we're looking at closely. If you think about the growth in our trading business in particular over the last several years, the constraint really to growth has been and we did grow, but the constraint to further growth has been availability of material. So, we are looking forward to opportunities to part out aircraft and bring more material to the market and capture a greater percentage there., The other thing that we expect to see as we go through this and our sales force is working very hard on this is airlines that may not have been historical users of used serviceable material, given the pressures on cost, we may see more conversions of customers that typically have been OEM buyers look for alternative sources like USM. So, as more material comes on the market, as well as we can convert more customers, take advantage of the cost savings that come with buying USM, we expect to see growth and recovery there., Yeah, I think that's a fair assessment. And just because aircraft are parked to retire does not necessarily mean they're going to go straight to part-out, that takes time. And there is only a certain amount of available capacity out there in the market to part out aircraft. So, there is a lot of factors at play in terms of how that new material or how that used material hit the market., Sure., Yeah. I don't know, but we don't necessarily comment on individual months, but we saw – throughout the quarter, we saw a 40% decline in total. And certainly, that accelerated between March and May. But the levels that we are seeing in June are slight – or saw in June and are seeing in July are slightly better than what we saw in April and May, but still at a depressed level. So, we're holding at the current position for the time being., Definitely see that potentially coming out from the airlines. We actually already are seeing it from the OEMs. So, in the distribution business, there has been a lot of discussions with OEMs at all levels in the supply chain of looking to – to your point, to take advantage of our relative strength in exchange for long-term distribution agreements. We are exceptionally focused on our liquidity position and our cash position. So, we're considering those deals very carefully. But we do view that as an opportunity to add strength to the distribution business which has been a great success story for the last few years., We went through a number of those discussions several months ago early in the quarter in terms of looking at extended terms for our airline customers. And that was pretty much – I wouldn't call that necessarily unusual, it's pretty much a universal request from all of our partners out there. And in turn, we flowed that down to our supply base as well. So, we have extended terms to our customers and we proceed to extend the terms from our supply base. And beyond that, we haven't seen any requests that I would consider unusual., I wouldn't think about the SG&A target necessarily in the context of revenue sizing, I would think about the SG&A target in – really around improving our margin. As you can tell, we're taking a lot of action during this period of time, and we're taking quick action to really change the structure of our cost base, as Sean mentioned, in many cases on a permanent basis going forward. We've had a number of margin improvement targets for a long time, and we're really using this time to accelerate our efforts in that regard., I don't know, Sean, if you want to..., Yeah. I would just add, Mike, my comment was over $50 million and it's across ISG&A, so indirect spend as well as SG&A, just wanted to clarify that., Yeah. So, we also are prepared for an extended period of depressed line. And that's the way we're modeling the business and the way we're sizing the business. As it relates to commercial programs in particular, that's a business that you did see a significant decline in that business right away because, just by definition, you bill based on flight hours and many of those customers had grounded nearly all of their fleet during the period of time. As Sean mentioned, we did take some charges in that area because those contracts to the extent that they are flexible enough to work in this environment, we leave them in place to the extent that the contract will not match the customers' operation and our requirements going forward. We're looking to restructure and stay with that customer. But in some cases, we've chosen to exit an agreement., And as we talked about for the last couple of quarters, that business even before COVID had been under pressure due to market dynamics and changes in costs in the supply chain. And once again, we're taking this opportunity to restructure that business so that, when we come out of this, it's much more profitable going forward., Yeah.., No. Great question. And converting inventory to cash is a very top priority for us. You saw the inventory come up because, pre-COVID, there were a number of agreements that were signed that had investment requirements. And we, in almost all cases, lived up to those commitments to our partners, particularly in the distribution business. So, that drove a lot of the inventory increase., We feel good about the position that we have. We feel good about the parts that we carry. The parts in particular in the commercial programs business, those are, by definition, for those parts the higher moving, higher consumed parts just the way those contracts work. So, it is material. In a normal environment, that would be high demand. But as you point out, we are not in a normal environment., So, we are redoubling our efforts to market that material very effectively, get creative in terms of trading material that we have against other services that may be required from the customer base, and looking to move it as best we can. But there's still, as we keep saying, a great deal of uncertainty out there in terms of how the overall fleet will unfold, and we may see certain asset classes where we would have expected a shorter life to actually get extended because new aircraft deliveries aren't going to occur. And so, we're watching that as well., And I do want to mention the point that I made to Rob Spingarn's question just around another effort we have underway is to convert customers to USM. This is a great time to, when there is material available particularly on our shelves within the market that can really tout the benefits of buying used material that is often available at 30%, 60%, 70% of list to customers that actually do have demand., And just one more point on that, we are seeing – if we look across different markets, we have seen a meaningful uptick in Asia. We are starting just in the last few weeks to see more activity out of Europe. Certainly, you've seen major changes here in North America, but that's another avenue is to go where the action is. And right now, we're redoubling our efforts in the market that are further ahead in the recovery as we look to move that material., We're definitely seeing pricing at the whole aircraft level decline and we're seeing some trades out there at meaningful discounts from where we saw it pre-COVID. Certain higher dollar LRUs, we've seen a bit of that, and we expect to see that, but nothing – no kind of macro specifics I can give you at this point terms of values at the part level., Hi, Josh., Yeah. I mean, obviously, there is a lot of action out there in that market, and you certainly have the traditional cargo carriers and we talk about our focus on it. We've got sales resources that previously have been covering dozens of commercial passenger accounts. Obviously, in many cases, their account base is as strong – or as just not as active as it was before, and we're redeploying those resources to focus on the cargo market. I mean, that's not parts, that's also heavy maintenance as well. We actually saw our first Boeing 747 cargo aircraft in our Miami maintenance facility. It's the first time we've done work on a Boeing 747 in a really long time in that facility, and we just completed one and shipped it off, and we're looking to do more with that particular customer. So, it's an area of focus and I think a opportunity for us, again, not just on the maintenance side, but also on the parts side as well., Yeah., Yeah. Yes. I would say that that is a very dynamic environment and definitely tracks with what you see out there in terms of their maintenance requirements are going to be aligned with the flying that they expect to do. And so, there is certainly no one is talking about bringing, at least to my knowledge that we're talking to, no one is talking about bringing work-in-house. Everybody is committed to the outsourced model. And there is a real interest and focus on the part of our customer base of making sure that top tier providers like AAR are around to service the aircraft when demand recovers., That expectation, I would say given recent events here in the US, has pushed out to the right versus where I think people were thinking it was going to be a month or six weeks ago. But everybody expects the recovery. Different customers have different expectations of the timeline of that recovery and they all recognize though that they're going to need an outsourced maintenance provider. And keeping our facilities full and running as best they can to make sure that we retain the workforce, so that if ready when they start to need maintenance at a greater scale is also a major focus of theirs., That is a great question. We are very excited about the partnership that we have with Napier. We've deployed only a fraction of that capital to date. And so, there is a great deal of dry powder to go out and look for opportunities. That said, there is still so much moving in the market. It's difficult at this moment to tell what a good deal really is. And so, we're paying very close attention to it, but we're also mindful that what we see today may look a lot different in a month and we're approaching that market for acquisition that ultimately could go to tear down short-term lease very cautiously., Thanks., Hi, Ken., Yeah. The backlog is less than it was, call it, a year ago. We were, again not to repeat, but we're encouraged by the dialogue that we're having from our customers and as much as there is going to be less work to go around, but they want to make sure that their top tier providers like AAR get the work, so that we can keep our operations running. We have both through, obviously, we closed our facility in Duluth and we have shrunk our footprint utilization at certain other facilities and unfortunately had to reduce our work force. We have sized our MRO operation for a much smaller labor utilization going into this fiscal year than we would have had last fiscal year. And so, against that smaller footprint as a percentage, we're actually sold out approximately the same percentage that we would have in a normal year, it's just on a much lower base., Yeah, closer to the higher end of that range, yeah., That is a dialogue we're having. We – the certain of our facilities, our facility in Rockford, facility in Miami, for example, that are wide body facilities and we have had interest in repatriating that work, that has been a dialogue that's out there for a long time, but there definitely given the current environment, I'd say renewed interest in bringing some of that work back. So, no particular deals in place there yet, but it is a conversation that we're having., Just to go back to your previous question, the one point I would want to make, our capacity in the MRO business is really – is driven by the amount of labor available to us, but not necessarily our footprint. So, even though we've reduced our footprint to the extent that we have demand and are able to secure labor to support that demand, we could actually see the same level of production off of this reduced footprint as we saw pre-COVID. And as Sean said, a number of the changes that we'd make like rationalizing our footprint position us to be more profitable coming out of this once we see demand return., Yeah. I would think about it at most the matter of quarters, but a lot of the airlines have – they've already started to burn that green time, right? I mean, they're moving engines from all of them. We saw our customers went very quickly into a cash conservation mode. And so, rather than sending engines to overhaul, they're swapping engines out on parked aircraft, et cetera, to the extent that there is removable LRUs that they can cannibalize. So, that's already occurring. In some ways, we think of it the opposite as there is actually a very significant amount of deferred maintenance that's building out there, so that when we see a return to flying, you might actually see a much quicker and more dramatic uptick in parts requirements and maintenance requirements, because that green time is being burned as we speak., We expect the government half of that business to be up in fiscal 2020. Even with the new additions depending on the timing, I would still say the commercial portion of that business, even with new wins, there would likely not be enough net new revenue to get the commercial business flat. Yeah. Yeah., Thanks., I think it depends on how ultimately the fleet shakes out. So, to the extent that you have more retirements and fleets that see more new aircraft deliveries and more retirements, we could lag. To the extent that you see airlines recover and either defer or cancel new aircraft deliveries and they've built up as I said before a pretty deferred – a pretty significant amount of deferred maintenance, you could see an increase well before., Yeah. First of all, no surprises. As a matter of fact, think about the larger ones, American was – that was announced many months ago and that was – it's expanded a little bit, but that was kind of already out there. So, no surprises and certainly, whether it's a Boeing 747, you're seeing a lot more retirements obviously in the wide body of Boeing 777s, et cetera, that's less significant to us, so not as concerned about that. And then you've got MD-80 or MD-80, MD-90s that have been retired, again, no surprises there., So, I think so far, we're not seeing – what we're seeing is tracking with what we would expect. And again, we're very eager based on particularly the engine support contract we have with certain shops to get our hands on material that previously prior to COVID would not have been available to us. So, we can support demand and albeit the overall demand will be depressed, but we expect to be able to support a greater percentage of that demand as things recover., Yeah, it's correct. The wide body exposure is very limited and we actually in the quarter, we wrote down our positions on the MD-80, MD-90. We wrote those positions off, there was some ATR material that we wrote off as well. So, anything, it's really truly red, we've already taken action on., Yeah, I mean, there could be. I think about, I don't know, five or six years ago when the Boeing 767 was dead and we couldn't give away 80C2 material, then all of a sudden, Amazon started flying and that became one of the hottest asset types around. There is no question, I mean, that's a great aircraft and it's hard to predict where they might find a home, but we certainly would – yeah, it's hard to predict where they'd find a home, but we certainly would expect use for an aircraft of that type., Yeah. On the first part, in terms of the balance sheet and the net working capital items in the quarter, accounts receivable, given the decline in the top line, we're able to work that down pretty significantly, it had been a big provider of cash. So, I'd say some of that was in line with just activity declining and that kind of new AR being put in, we were able to work down in the quarter. And then on accounts payable, I'd say in a similar way, there was a lot less new purchasing activity because we tried to really focus on cash flow generation. So, this was taking things that weren't aged, but the payables that were coming due and managing them at the end of the fiscal year. So, that's the two biggest. And then on contract assets, the activity in the hangars comes down, that kind of comes down in line with some of those activity which is a net provider of cash because of that dynamic., In terms of kind of where the top line need to be in terms of breakeven, for us, we're kind of not giving guidance on that, but when we think about where the balance sheet is, I mean, the amount of inventory we have and focus on turning the inventory into cash, I'd say there is not a kind of bright line of where sales for the whole company needs to be as long as we can kind of continue to focus on inventory and limit new buys, caveat being that as we take advantage of our relative position of strength for things like Unison and other items that come up, we're going to want to put some capital to work on new positions to expand our market share in this period of time., Yeah, good question and we'll kind of stay away from forecasting or guiding on that, but there are activities that continue to take place in Q1. One, Composites, we included in the 8-K and mentioned previously that be about $20 million charge associated with the divestiture of that business. And I would expect there is other kind of activities whether it be head count or facility and then we're reviewing the portfolio on some of these contracts, but can't say today what that would look like., Sorry, I would just add that we're very focused on any action that we take that results in a onetime event that action is going to have a meaningful improvement on the profitability of the company going forward., I would say that over time it will improve, but I would not expect sequential improvement. And again, the reason we're not giving guidance is because we are in such a dynamic environment right now., Great., Hey, Rob. How are you?, Sure. Yeah. Let me – I'll talk to the businesses. Thinking about the parts businesses, trading and distribution, we did see relatively consistent performance from each of those businesses in terms of order volume each month during the quarter. MRO did improve through the quarter, and August, for example, was a better month than June. We expect MRO to improve from the Q1 level as we head into Q2., What we meant by being encouraged is, yeah, as we sat here three months ago, we didn't have a clear visibility and I would say had lower expectations of the MRO loading that we expected to see in the second quarter as we head into the fall and into winter. And so far, the indications from our customers are better than we expected at the beginning of Q1., I would say that we certainly look at it in terms of labor hours that we produced. Q2 will be a better quarter in that regard than Q1, but still well below what we produced a year ago. Beyond that, at this point, I wouldn't want to give any specifics., What I would say is that as you're talking and seeing from all of the commercial airlines, there continues to be quite a bit of movement out there in terms of what they expect in the way of demand, and certainly, headlines in the last few days would indicate there's things going on in Europe, et cetera, and questions about what can happen here in the US. But at this point, we've got pretty good dialogue and reasonable visibility to what we expect to see in the second quarter., Yeah. I would say in MRO, yeah. I would say it's consistent to that in Q1., Yes., Yeah. There were – we're seeing a – some positioning for holiday travel. So, that's typically what drives the demand in the fall. And then, the demand that we see throughout the winter and the spring is getting ready for summer travel. And we're seeing a lot of movement inside the airlines as much as, on the one hand, they want to conserve cash and be conservative. On the other hand, they don't want to miss out to the extent that there is an increase in bookings and they have the ability to add more routes., Yeah., Yeah. I'll answer the second part first. Yes, we are seeing indications from customers that previously wouldn't have been interested in aftermarket material, specifically over in Asia, that are now appear to be more receptive to that, and we do expect that to be a trend., Going back to the first part of the question, there does seem to be a disconnect out there between announced fleet reduction and actual retirements. We haven't seen as many actual retirements as we would expect at this point, and therefore, we actually haven't seen as many aircraft go to part out as we would expect at this point, but we do anticipate that. We are at a very fortunate position with our balance sheet that once we do start to see aircraft that are appealing to us come available, we're in a position to make those investments once we have a clearer sense of what the market's going to look like., Okay. Thanks, Rob., Hi, Joe. How are you?, Yeah. At this point, we expect relatively consistent performance throughout the year. Our defense business has held up well, both on the transactional side meeting the defense element of our distribution and certainly the program activity., You did see some movement this quarter. We saw really nice improvement out of Mobility, as we mentioned. I would characterize that as elevated activity this quarter. We would expect to see that return to more normal levels in subsequent quarters. But overall the government business has been fairly consistent throughout this period, and we would expect that to remain the case. Having said all that, we do have, as I mentioned, a robust pipeline of bids as well as RFPs that we're responding to. So, there's still quite a lot of activity out there in the government space., Everything is moving very slowly right now. COVID, it's slow to begin with than we've talked a lot about obviously the protest complications when we go after these new contracts, but COVID has definitely slowed things down in the acquisition world in the government. So, that's slowing things. But there are wins that could convert and contribute to this fiscal year. And to the extent that we're successful in any of those, we'll certainly announce it and discuss how it might improve the results further., Yeah. So just on the gross margin, yeah, you did see that uptick in Expeditionary Services, the majority of which came from the Mobility business. Within Aviation Services, you saw margin degradation down to 12% from 15% in the previous year. Government really kind of was relatively flat. So, a lot of that degradation came from that weakness in the commercial top line. So, that can give you a bit of a picture of kind of margin year-over-year between commercial activities and government. And we expect that government, excluding that Mobility piece, should largely be consistent for the year., Yeah. Sure. I guess two thoughts there. It really depends on the customer in terms of where they are. With certain customers that we speak to, and this is – these are global comments, it's very much a survival conversation. With other customers, though, we are having, I would say, very progressive conversations about how our solutions can help them. And that's certainly with existing customers and relatively new customers like Frontier, and we've had a relationship with Frontier to varying degrees over the years, but it's been largely transactional in this contract. It's not a huge contract dollar-wise, but we were very happy to get something signed up on a multi-year basis with Frontier., And I would say it's emblematic of how airlines will look towards solutions, whether that's USM or outsourcing maintenance that they hadn't outsourced before, et cetera. It's emblematic of how airlines are likely going to want to be and need to be a lot more creative about how they manage their costs through this period. And the Airinmar offering around warranty management and warranty claims, as well as repair cycle management, is a creative offering. So, happy to see Frontier sign that contract and we'll look for more of that., Yeah. I would expect the conversations to become more robust as time goes on. And on that note, we have seen just in the last few weeks, there were multiple projects and multiple initiatives that we had with various customers pre-COVID. Many of those things were put on hold because of COVID because it was just all hands on deck. We have seen certain customers expressed an interest in restarting those conversations now that they've got better stability. But again, it really does vary by the customer., Thank you., Hi, Ken. How are you?, Yeah. That's a great question. We are, at this point, in order to meet the demand, we are calling back many of our employees who are out on furlough. And actually, at a couple of our sites, we are hiring beyond that furlough – beyond employees that we're bringing back from furlough. When we furloughed, of course, but if we let people go, we did our very best to make sure that with our best people, that we stayed in contact with them, and obviously, treated them right as we were downsizing. And so far, in the markets, we're actually having reasonable success in attracting talent., This is something we've been very public about. We are very focused on all of the initiatives that we had heading into COVID, our partnerships with schools, our training, everything that we could do to develop a proprietary pipeline of talent. We've done our very best through the last six months to keep those initiatives going because we want to make sure that as demand recovers, we've got access to the very best talent in the industry. We are aware that there are some competitors out there that are hiring as well, and we want to make sure that AAR is the employer of choice., So, short answer to your question is we're in the market, we are bringing people back from furlough, and we are hiring net new people at certain sites. And so far, it's going okay, but we're very aware of what full recovery could look like, and the fact that you've had people potentially permanently leave the workforce, so we got to make sure that we're getting new talent out of the school., Yeah. Sure. So far, broadly, we've been able to maintain rates. Again, there's individual negotiations that happen all the time, but broadly, we've been able to maintain rates. We haven't had meaningful discussions about raising rates at this point., As it relates to our labor costs, when we were – we had a very high reliance on contract labor for the two years heading into COVID. That was a real source of labor for us. The contract labor, or flat rate teams, which is another version of contract labor, those definitely come at a higher cost than full-time employees. As we rebuild our labor force, we are very focused on rebuilding it with full-time employees., Contract labor makes sense to an extent as you're flexing up and down, because invariably, you have ups and downs inside a facility. But as a percentage, we want to be more disciplined about the overall level of contract labor that we employ in the hangars. So, the cost of a full-time employee hasn't changed. But overall, we're working on managing the cost of our labor by managing the mix between full time and contract., When you say come in lower, do you mean the number of retirements or the level of demand?, We do expect – what as you'd imagine, we've got a number of scenarios that we look at and it's, as you know better than anybody, it's a very dynamic situation right now. In general, we absolutely expect more material availability than we saw pre-COVID. And our limit to growth pre-COVID was really at material availability. But we became the, in our view, the best of the market at sourcing and getting our hands on the very best material., From that pre-COVID baseline, it's difficult to calculate exactly how much more will be available. But we do expect net new availability of aftermarket material headed into a recovery. How you reconcile that against elevated demand, again, is another question. But net-net, we would expect all of that to be a positive for our aftermarket trading business., And the only other additional comment I would say to that, if you overlay that, and we mentioned this in our remarks, we do expect elevated demand coming out of the – as we go into the recovery because there's been so much deferred maintenance particularly on engines, and that's going to drive a great deal of USM requirements., Our focus right now, as we mentioned, is really on working capital and we're very – yeah. We're very pleased with the fact that we were able to reduce our inventory by $19 million during the quarter, as we mentioned, after you adjust for the accounts receivable and the CARES money, be $10 million cash flow positive., So we think in this environment, that's a great accomplishment. And generating cash is the main focus of ours going forward. We want to make sure that we do those things, so that we have the balance sheet and the confidence so that when we see the right material come on the market, we've got first-mover advantage and have the capital to outmaneuver our competitors to pick it up at the best price., Yeah., Yeah. That's a great point. That is a joint venture that's still in place. There's a great deal of dry powder associated with that joint venture. We are in very regular dialogue with our partners who are very aware of all the dynamics in the market right now. And that also could be a source of capital to acquire aircraft that are on lease, and how to keep on lease for a period of time or acquire aircraft that on sublease that could also – that ultimately be used for the trading business. But again, there's still so many moving parts right now. Our focus is on building up our own cash position so that we can make moves when we feel confident in the pricing., Yeah. And you're right there on the exited contract, that was an underperforming contract, a bit in the same vein of some actions we've taken over the past couple quarters of trying to take this opportunity to exit underperforming contracts where it makes sense. So that's what the exited contract is., And then the rotable asset impairment, as you recall, the rotable assets support the program's activities. And as we've – the flight hours have come down and as we've exited certain programs, we took a look at the assets we had in place and ones that were no longer supporting the programs, mark them to fair value. So that's what that – the impairment charges in the quarter., Yeah. It would be fair to say that we are very actively managing that portfolio. And as Sean mentioned, over the last couple quarters, we've taken action to either restructure or, in the cases related to the charges, completely exit underperforming contracts. Many of the program customers, their fleets are still in flux. It's not completely clear how they will come back and the complexion of those fleets., And we're working very closely with those customers, if it makes sense, to restructure the contract and keep it in place to support wherever they land on the new fleet composition and their expected flying hours, we'll work with them to do that. However, if it's going to be too far out of bounds from what we contemplated when we signed the agreement, we're going to exit. I'd say the majority of the heavy lifting in that portfolio has been done. But there still are some customers that we are in dialogue with right now., We feel good about the fact that the bookings in Q1 were above and were stable at a level above where they were in Q4. And it's difficult to predict whether or not that's the bottom. Certainly, there's – it all depends on people's confidence with flying and the virus and the vaccine, et cetera, et cetera. But the last several months have been consistent in our parts businesses, and we talked a lot about the maintenance business. So, at this point, unless there's a second wave that throws things off, I would expect that we saw the bottom in Q4., Yeah. From the order volume that we see, and particularly the loading in the hangars from our larger customers, reflects their current view on the fleet. But as we've said over and over again, that could change., We're seeing less movements in maintenance schedules, et cetera, than we did a quarter ago, but still, it's very dynamic., I think it's still pretty strong. I think that's a great point and then you might be getting to the stage where it could be overshooting itself. Obviously, there've been some deals announced in recently where aircraft have – fleets of aircraft have been acquired that are going to go to freighter. But I think, at this point, it's still pretty strong. But there is a lot of interest there and that very quickly can get frothy., That's a great question. We continue to see, albeit at depressed levels, traffic through our digital channels. There are a number of initiatives that we had begun pre-COVID. We paused a couple of those but we've restarted them to bring new digital services to market and have really used this time to reflect on what we think will be successful going forward. I'm encouraged by the continued interest from our customers on all sorts of digital solutions. And we're fortunate to be in a position where we've got the capital to continue to make the investments. But digital and the development around it remains a core part of the strategy., Thank you., Yeah. Sure. In the US, there are still a number of large carriers both – yeah, a number of large carriers where we do a little bit of business with but we see a lot of opportunity. For example, we could have one major airline where we feel we've done a great job penetrating the account and we're doing over $100 million. We have another airline with a very similar fleet where we do less than $10 million. And so I do see a reasonable amount of opportunity here in the US both with, call it, the major carriers as well as the lower cost carriers., By market, Asia, we've had a great run in Asia over the last several years, but still, there's an enormous amount of opportunity with the larger Asian carriers as they look to adopt non-OEM solutions and look for aftermarket solutions like ours. And that's – some of the real bright spots we've seen in the last several months have been, in particular, inquiries from our Asian customers where we might do a little bit of business, but how can we do more, how can we do more together. And it's early days. But those conversations wouldn't have happened or were not happening a year ago, so that's encouraging., I'd also – beyond Asia, I would also put the Middle East in that category as well in as much as, historically, those operators have been very focused on OEM-based solutions. And while we haven't had the kind of dialogue yet that we've had with some of our Asia customers, I would expect and hope that we would see more opportunity coming out of the Middle East for us., Hey, Rob. How are you?, Yeah. It was actually – it was fairly stable throughout the quarter. I would agree that we've seen the trough, the parts volume, the MRO volumes that all come up from what we saw in the April and May timeframe. But heading into the June-July period, the volumes that we saw across the business were relatively stable in the month following., Yeah. Really it depends on the customers. Certainly, you've seen some of the larger carriers that have MAXes on order. They've gone ahead and started taking delivery of those MAXes, customers that had MAX already in their fleet. They've begun operating those, so those customers appear to be committed to that path., Broader, though, as you know, you have seen a number of cancellations of the MAX and the corresponding theme is that we have seen customers, at the same time, they're going to introduce new aircraft. They've also indicated to us that they do expect to hold on to some older aircraft longer than they would have anticipated over throughout COVID., All of them, though, I should say, have expressed and again, this is customers that are current USM customers as well as customers in regions like China that are not USM customers. We have seen an interest across the board in USM material and during the quarter, we did start to see more aircraft become available for acquisition and ultimately for tear down. So that chain of events where you see an aircraft put on the ground then ultimately retire then ultimately sold potentially to someone like us who might tear it down, you've seen a bit more of that come into the market and therefore, we expect the supply to start increasing., Yeah. No. We – and I don't want to get too much into detail for competitive reasons, but we've seen a pretty wide range of opportunities, I would say., I think overall, it's – I mean, I would view it as a positive. I mean, companies like ours exist to provide a necessary service. I mean that maintenance – that maintenance capability has largely been outsourced by most of the carrier. Unless you see a compelling event for them to start insourcing that activity, we believe that the volume of work will continue to exist for third-party maintenance providers and us in particular., We would expect that we will come out of this crisis at higher operating margins than we were pre-COVID., And, yeah, and that's due to a number of factors, largely to the actions that we've taken but your point on contract labor is right on. We've done a number of things to reset activities inside of our hangars and we do not expect to be as reliant on contract labor going forward as we had been in the past. That's certainly a contributor., We have a number of other efficiency initiatives that we're in the process of implementing inside the hangars. So that will be a lot more efficient as that line of work comes back. But then additionally, there were a number of less profitable activities or unprofitable activities that existed at the company pre-COVID. And over the last three quarters, we've done a lot of work to eliminate that drag from our earnings and as we recover the stronger performance out of our parts businesses, for example, as well as increased efficiency in the hangar, you'll start to see that come through in better margins., Thanks, Rob., Sure. Again, you're in a situation where the conversation varies by customer but the general themes are there is a focus on summer 2021 readiness. And what was different about the quarter we went through versus our first quarter, during the summer, if you recall, we went through another surge, not nearly as significant as the surge we're in now, but there was another surge. And at that point, we did see quite a bit of movement in the maintenance schedule, in parts-buying behavior out of the customer base., We did not see and have not seen that same movement in behavior as we've gone through this most recent surge as the customers appear to be focused. Okay, we're going to have some ups and downs over the next few months but at the end of the day, the vaccine will be distributed. There's pent-up demand for leisure travel and we want to be ready for that in summer 2021., So while the – I would say the level of expectation over of increase in summer 2021 travel over summer 2020 varies by customer, overall the customers expect to have a better summer in 2021 than they did in 2020 and they want to be ready for it., Sure. I mean in terms of overall size, I would go back to what we mentioned earlier. We expect to be in a relatively stable revenue environment until you see a meaningful increase in flying activities but at the same time, we remain very focused on continuing to improve our margins in that stable environment., If I take the three areas of the commercial business, in the parts business, both new and used parts as we mentioned earlier, we've seen relatively stable activity. We have had what I would call kind of higher highs, if you will, during the last few weeks, which is encouraging. But still, overall, we would expect stable activity in the commercial parts business., Coming out of the crisis, as we've talked about, we definitely expect increased demand for the USM business. We're really excited about our partnership with Fortress. That's one of many initiatives we have going on right now on the USM side. But I would expect that business to potentially be structurally larger than it was pre-COVID, depending on how the demand shakes out., Similarly, on the new parts distribution business, we continue to add new distributorship. There are a number of opportunities out there that we are evaluating for new parts distributorships with different OEMs. Much like the airlines, the OEMs have – they are taking a look at their approach to the aftermarket. And similarly, as they think about their cost structures, we are seeing some interest from OEMs that previously might not have considered a distribution partner. Now, they are looking at a distribution partner. And so we're evaluating those opportunities and we think that that business could also emerge larger thanks to new business wins, as well as same-store sales, if you will, increase on the agreements that we had prior to COVID., In the MRO business, I would say that we feel very good about the footprint that we have. We took out capacity, which was a very difficult decision, but we took out capacity by closing our Duluth facility, as well as rationalize our footprint inside of other facilities that are still in the network. And we believe that ultimately, we'll get a better yield out of that footprint than we did pre-COVID because of some of the changes that we've made., And finally, on the commercial programs business, that's a business where we've made a lot of changes over the last several quarters. As we talked about, we've exited or restructured underperforming contracts. The majority of that work is now behind us. We feel good about the remaining contract portfolio and I believe we talked about this last quarter but now that market had seen a lot of pricing pressure pre-COVID, and you've seen a number of the participants in that market make moves, even exit the market entirely or also like us, exit underperforming contracts. And we believe that you could see pricing in that market reset post-COVID, and to the extent that it does, and we believe that we can earn a return, we'll be a participant in that market., Yes., Sure. In terms of work, I mean all of our customers are reevaluating their operating models. I mean you have to going through a shock like we've been through. So we're having a variety of conversations both with existing customers and as you point out, with customers that may not have pursued an outsourced model to the extent that they may consider now. So there's a lot of moving parts there., And then as it relates to the operating efficiency inside of the hangars, yeah, we feel very good about the changes that we have made. We believe the footprint that we have is the right footprint to take the work that we expect to get over the next few quarters, as well as the increased volumes as the overall market recovers. And we do expect much greater yield out of the labor hours that we produce based on the efficiency that we've built in. Again there's a lot of moving pieces there, and we're extremely grateful for the support of our customers through this. And we're very excited to continue to provide the maintenance services to them as they recover., Hey., Sure. Thanks for asking about that. We're very excited about the partnership with Fortress. We've worked with Fortress for many years, and have a great respect for what the team over there is doing in the industry. And this agreement really plays to both of our strengths. They've got a very large and growing engine lease pool, and we are the number one participant in the USM space., So, the agreement basically calls for us to manage engines through a teardown process out of their engine pool, and we have complete control over that management. Some of the material will be sold back to Fortress for use in their own engine build, and the rest of the material will be sold by us into the aftermarket. And there are volume commitments between us and Fortress. And those volume commitments will mean it will be a meaningful increase through our aftermarket parts activity, and these are core engine platforms. So, we're excited to be a participant – even bigger participant in that market., As it relates to timing, we would expect volume to see volume later this fiscal year, and then it would grow throughout our FY 2022., It's an asset-light agreement. We'll be investing in repairs, but not the assets themselves., Historically, what I – historically, what you just said, I would agree with that. Coming out of this downturn, just because it's been so broad and extended, and because of the significant deferred maintenance particularly on engines that has built up over the last several months, it's possible that we could see concurrent recovery between the parts business as well as the heavy maintenance business, or the parts business could lead the recovery. Right now, the loading that we have in the hangars is relatively consistent over the next couple of quarters, but as the – as our customers have better visibility into their demand going into summer 2021, you could see that change as well., I think that we're burning green time now., And so – yeah. And so we're looking at ultimately as that green times comes down, the deferred balance is growing, if you will, and that would require more parts sooner., Yeah. I mean, you got a lot of moving parts there, but that could be true., You very well could. Our stable outlook right now reflects what the commitments are that we have. To the extent that the customers see increased booking and they see that demand increase, then you're absolutely right, there could be more demand. I don't know that any of our customers right now are expecting a return to normal levels of flying in summer 2021. I think that they're expecting certainly an increase in 2021 over 2020. But I think many of them still have modest expectations. Having said that though, I mean, the situation continues to evolve very quickly. I know our customers, they – bookings and cancellations are happening in real time for them, and so they don't have a lot of visibility into demand. So, I think as soon as they have a clear picture of summer 2021, they absolutely could be calling for more maintenance and more parts., Yeah. Yeah., I think that – I think what you just said, the next to last thing that you said is, okay, it's going to be a bit of an up and down patch here for the next few months, but we need to move past that and be ready for summer 2021. And I believe that at least the commitments that they have made to us that they are based on, what I'll call, kind of a conservative case of what they expect summer 2021 flying to be., In other words, they're committing to us because they know that, for example, the maintenance business, we need to have solid lines of maintenance to keep the team together and keep them working. And so, right now, they've committed to a level of loading that they know they can get to the extent that they end up with a better summer, they may require more maintenance. We just haven't seen that order book form up yet., Yeah. Good question. So far, wages have remained relatively stable. We have, I think, done a really nice job of retaining and recruiting a much more experienced workforce. And that experienced workforce is delivering great results for our customers in terms of quality and turnaround time performance. And so, as I mentioned earlier, our reliance on contract labor is much reduced from where it was pre-COVID, and that is a ratio that we are really focused on preserving. And that's one of the reasons during this time that – the main reason we took CARES Act funding is we have done everything we can, whether we're furloughing people or, in the worst case, we've had to let people go, thinking maybe one day we'd need them back. We've done everything that we can to treat our people the best as we can throughout this period., As Sean mentioned, one of the decisions that we made a few weeks ago was to restore salaries and benefits for our workforce so that at all levels in the company, whether you're in an office or in a hangar, your pay has been restored, and we can keep the team together. So, we're doing everything we can to treat our people well, and I think that's going to serve us well in the marketplace as we go out and continue to build the workforce. And we'll be able to get the best talent available., Yeah. I would just say that we don't want to get into the margins and particular details around that specific agreement. But I would say again that we're excited about it, and it will be – it will, over time, become a meaningful part of our USM business., Hey, Rob., Well, not sure if there's an algorithm but let me try to take it piece by piece across the company. As we mentioned on the government side, in the past quarter, in the third quarter, we saw significant growth on the government side. And at this point, we see that continuing or we see that government business remaining strong and we expect continued growth there. Cargo as well, cargo through contracts that we have in our parts businesses, the supply engine providers, our engine overhaul providers with parts for cargo customers as well as an activity in the MRO business, we expect the cargo business to hold up and potentially expand as I mentioned., In terms of airline customers in MRO, we are in constant contact with all of our major customers and this is a very dynamic environment and really does change daily. Right now, we have a fair amount of work in the hangars, they're largely full, but we anticipate a meaningful decline in that work as we head towards the summer. We're getting different information out of different customers at this time in terms of the schedules that they're putting together. The one encouraging part in all of that is that we, for many of our MRO customers, are the main maintenance provider and they recognize the importance of keeping solid lines of work with companies like us and us in particular and the message has been, we'll do everything we can to keep you full. Now that said, we are expecting a meaningful decline in maintenance activity across the facilities as we head into the summer., And then in terms of the airline parts businesses, both new, or parts sales both new and used, we would suggest that those – it's early to tell and the business actually has been holding up, up until just the last few days. We did see some decline out of Asia in the third quarter and that's continued but the business has been holding up. But we have seen a decline just in the last few days and we are anticipating that that business tracks, the parts business tracks with – parts business and commercial PBH business tracks with ASMs., Yeah. It's not something we typically put out and it fluctuates but typically, we see it between 10% and 15% of the commercial business., Yeah. Given the nature of our business, you think about most of our cost is variable, because if you think about the parts supply activities, our cost of sales is obviously the inventory that we procure that we're going to have on the shelf or we buy in the market and the other parts of it are shipping and sales, right? So it's really variable cost associated with activity. Where you have some greater fixed cost is on the infrastructure to support, obviously, the hangars and the MROs. Again, a lot of the labor there is more variable in nature in terms of contracts and the people that support the activity. And then in commercial programs, some of the infrastructure to support the supply chain has a more fixed nature to it. So I think we have a highly variable cost structure across the whole company. There are pockets where it's a bit more variable parts supply and some fixed costs in the hangars and other areas., I think – yeah. No. And I think as you're indicating there, this is definitely an evolving situation. We're certainly in a mode right now where we are drawing down on existing parts inventories. And as we see things settle out and as we see opportunities arise, we would look to potentially make investments. But right now, we are very focused on the liquidity required to operate the business and using the stock that we have to satisfy demand., Hi, Ken., So I feel good about the actions that we took to address those contracts, they had been a headwind for us as we've indicated in the last couple of quarters. So those were in response to restructuring that occurred within our customers. And so I'm happy that we were able to take those actions. And they will – as we said, they'll provide an improvement in margin and an improvement in cash flow as a result of those actions. In the context though of COVID-19, Power-by-the-Hour contracts, as the name implies, are built on flying hours of the airlines and we have seen reductions across all of those fleets that we support. And certain of those contracts have got minimum flight hour protections in there although we're certainly in uncharted waters in terms of how those protections will be enforced. And so we're in a dialogue with all of our customers about how our program support going forward will look as they assess the impact of their own fleet as a result of COVID-19., Yeah. On the parts side, I think you have it right. We really just in the last few days have started to see decline evolve. It was actually decline in volume. It was actually holding up fairly well just into the last couple of days. And as airlines ground fleet and look to cannibalize parts from aircraft that are on the ground, we would expect a meaningful decline in those day-to-day parts activities both in terms of trade – but typically in terms of trading, the distribution business that's largely consumables, expendable. So those aren't parts that necessarily that would be cannibalized. But as airlines go through what they have on the shelf, we'll see a slowdown, and then we could see some replenishment orders there. But I expect overall that volume on the new parts side to decrease as well., On the maintenance side, again, provided the aircraft come back, those are maintenance deferrals. And we would be working closely with our customers to make sure that we're in a position to handle the maintenance events when they start to put aircraft back into service. And I would expect that activity to pace ahead of a recovery in the parts business., Yeah. Great question. And the answer is, we have. In the last few weeks, we have seen some activity particularly out of China going into – about halfway through the third quarter, we started to see a meaningful decline in order volumes out of China in particular and a bit less impacted across all of Asia. But in the last two weeks, we have seen some increased activity. As a matter of fact, last week, we received a multi-million-dollar purchase order for a landing gear from a Chinese carrier, and that's a big order in any environment particularly in this environment. So there definitely are signs of life with that market returning., Thanks, Ken., We typically don't split out those elements of the Aviation Services segment. But if you look at Aviation Services, it's roughly a third, a third, a third; a third MRO, a third of parts, and then a third of programs. And in the programs, it's roughly split between government and commercial. So we would see the commercial Power-by-the-Hour programs tracking with ASMs. And then inside the parts business, with the exception of the government portion of that business and the cargo portion of that business, which I would put it a bit more than half, we would see the remaining half of the parts business tracking with ASMs., Yes., Yeah. Our commercial business is roughly about 40% international. So when we talk about ASMs, I would weight that by geography. So, call it, 40% international and 60% domestic., And as you know in the..., ...in the hangars, that's five in the US, which services the domestic narrow-body market, two in Canada, similar dynamic there, and then some landing gear facility in Miami and then two component repair facilities in New York and Amsterdam. So within MRO specifically, it's overweighed towards the domestic US market and Canada., Yeah. So as I mentioned in my script, we have about $435 million of liquidity. The revolver we upsized back just in the fall. So the maturity is until 4.5 years from now, in the fall of 2024, and we upsized it to $100 million to $600 million in total at that time. And that's the available liquidity the company has. We also put in an AR financing program a couple years ago and there is some availability under that., So in terms of where we sit today on liquidity, I think we feel good. We're, obviously, contingency planning and in discussions with our banks to make sure that that stays the same. But feel good about the actions that we've taken over the last, call it, six months and where we sit today. And I'll also add..., I'd just add, the actions we're obviously taking both in terms of overhead and fixed costs are all with an eye to improving the cost as well as the cash position of the company., Yeah. So the Q3 charge is the $24.7 million that's obviously specific to the restructuring actions in the programs, the $15 million to $20 million range, the estimate we provided for Q4 are for the Q4 actions as well as the facility actions, as well as the people and overhead actions, that split roughly evenly between kind of facility actions and people actions. And I would say that that reflects the demand environment with – tracked to some of the things you talked about here in terms of activity in the hangars and ASMs. Should things deteriorate, we're watching the situation closely. It's still relatively early. As we mentioned in the script, we would be ready to take additional action if needed., Hey, Mike., Yeah. In both situations, you had fleet changes that occurred at the customer that drove a pretty significant difference between what was impacted or what was expected when we signed the contract versus what we actually felt. And we've had negotiations with those customers in recent months to try to correct for that. And, ultimately, we ended up in a position where we needed to restructure the contract and take charge. That's the element of the customer side of it., On our side, we had a pretty rapid expansion into that business. As you recall, we signed up a lot of contracts with a lot of different operators and a lot of different environments and it was a pretty stretched supply chain. And these were some of the earliest agreements that we signed as we got into that business. And our pricing, our operation and the contractual protections that we look for in those agreements evolved over that period of time but these were earlier agreements in that regard., I would say we're taking a look at the liquidity position of all of our customers and I wouldn't limit that statement to just our commercial Power-by-the-Hour contract holders. We're looking across the whole portfolio. And having said that, our largest customers we feel very good about their own financial management and we've got very close relationships with them and are in very active dialogue with them in terms of our exposure and their plans. So, overall, I feel good about our AR portfolio. Having said that, we're certainly in an environment where you are going to see some failures and we've done our own analysis on where those may occur and we're going to do everything we can to limit our exposure., Yeah. I think as you mentioned, obviously, over the last few years in a growth environment where we've not only been outgrowing the industry taking share as part of that, it's been a somewhat capital-intensive business in terms of the inventory and the rotable assets we've invested in to support that growth. As you sit here today with the balance sheet we have and the inventory position, to your point, we're obviously very, very focused on turning the inventory position, the investments we've made into cash. So I think you'll see maybe a higher conversion on inventory as you put less on the shelf and monetize what we have., As we talked about here, I do think that in the environment we're in, that will be what we're driving to and then in terms of some of the other levers on the balance sheet AR and AP specifically, we're going to manage both of those given the current environment., Sorry, Mike, I was just going to add that we do expect to see opportunities as a result of this market dislocation and we see opportunities in terms of potential asset acquisition opportunities, in terms of being a potential talent acquisition. And we do see clearing out, to Sean's point, of some of the competition that has come into the market both from small players that may exit completely and very large players that may decide they want to focus on other things. So we've been here a long time. We've seen versions of these things before and a big reason why we maintain such a strong balance sheet is so that we can come out of situations like this even stronger., Yeah. Definitely. The answer to that is absolutely. We want to time that correctly because we're in a moat here where we need to see how things are going to shape up, but absolutely. And I would mention that we've talked about this for several quarters now the demand for aftermarket material has far, far exceeded the supply in the last several quarters. And so obviously, you're going to have a meaningful decline in demand and an increase in supply., But given our position and given the relationships that we have and the network we have to get our hands on the best material out there, we should be in a position to – even though it might be lower demand – fulfill more of it as a percentage than we have been able to in the past as a result of more material coming on the market. And that's our job is to make sure that we time that correctly and make the right investments and get our hands on that choice materials you referenced before anyone else., Thank you., Yes. That could happen. That could happen., Yeah. I wouldn't cite any asset class in particular at this point. But that's certainly something we're paying close attention to. And a lot of the inventory that we carry is tied to long-term contracts. And, again, there was a bow wave of maintenance events where the demand outstripped the amount of inventory that we could find. So even if you do see some early retirements or an overall decrease in demand, we feel pretty good about the inventory position that we've got right now., Yeah. I think it's important to remember that USM is a lower cost solution. And in environments like this, where airlines are really managing their costs much more closely than they may have been before, you may see greater adoption of USM. And that would be a fortunate development to the extent that we see greater USM on the right platforms become available on the market. So that is a dynamic that we could see play out, and we've seen that play out in past with dislocations as well., Sure. No. As I mentioned, we had a very good quarter and our defense government programs revenues were up meaningfully in the quarter. And so, it's largely business as usual. I'd add that the pipeline for us on the government side has continued to grow. Those awards take a long time due to the procurement process as well as the protest process inside of the government. But we've built a great franchise. We're able to bid on more contracts than we ever have been before because of our broad-based past portfolio – or past performance portfolio. And I would expect to continue to see growth there, but it's going to come in chunks as these contracts are awarded over time., I think that's a good point. I think you could see some net new work come on to the market, given the environment, as airlines look to – if they're looking to alter a union agreement or another contract that might allow them to outsource work, this would certainly be a backdrop to do that. So we could see net new work come on the market. I would also expect that you may have seen some of the domestic competitors not make this through. So you could see at least for a period of time a contraction in the amount of available hangar space., And while we're very focused and, as I mentioned, we've been in dialogue with the government about potential aid to preserve our workforce to the extent that our new mechanics that are on the market, we could be in a position to bring on a workforce to expand capacity to the extent that's necessary. But there are so many moving parts right now it's difficult to forecast how all that is going to play out. And right now, we just want to make sure that we've got our cost base rightsized to support the demand that we see over the next few quarters., I think it's a little early to speculate on that. I do think that a lot of that does have to do with what the government – what actions the government takes and what potential aid may be out there to preserve workforce. To the extent that there is not aid available, you may see a supply of labor come on to the market that we haven't seen in several years and that could impact labor rates. But right now, it's pretty early to tell., Thank you., No, not as a long-term strategy. We continue to believe that that as well as the inclusion of all – as well as the inclusion of greater intellectual property generally defined in our portfolio whether that's PMA, DERs, digital et cetera all of that is part of the long-term strategy. That said, as you can imagine, we are taking a look at all of our investment projects right now and we're going to moderate those or pace those with how we see the demand for the core services unfolding., Our conversations with the government – again, I've been personally involved in a lot of these over the last several days, our points are that a bailout or aid package needs to address more than just the airlines, it needs to address a broader aviation services industry because companies like ours particularly around heavy maintenance are a vital link in keeping the aircraft of the United States flying. And many airlines have outsourced those activities and they no longer have the capability., And given the tightening, given the tightness in labor that we've seen over the last few years, we want to make sure that to the extent that there is a decrease in demand and technicians are let go from various companies including our own that we're able to – or that as other industries recover faster than aviation might, we don't lose those technicians to other industries. And we want to make sure that we preserve that heavy maintenance capability in particular in America. So our conversations have been largely around providing aid to companies like ours either in the form of grants or loans with forgiveness that would be directed towards preserving the workforce."
1004,2021.0,Q&A,a,"Yeah. We definitely have been seeing, and I think this has been publicly said by many of our larger airline customers, more and more optimism about the pace of the recovery. That's driven some customers to want to add more aircraft to the maintenance schedule. We have, in the last few weeks, seen a slight continued improvement in the volume through the parts business., As Sean mentioned, at the beginning of the summer, the May and June timeframe, we had seen some very robust volumes in our parts business. When the Delta variant concerns kind of took hold and airlines pulled back their flying schedules, we saw that taper off throughout the summer. But as more and more airlines talk about putting more aircraft back into service and getting those flight schedules closer to pre-pandemic levels, we are seeing a slight uptick in the parts volume here in the last few weeks., So, I think there's a lot of optimism. Obviously, it's been up and down. So, with that optimism, still comes some uncertainty. But at this moment, I think the fact the borders are opening up and you're starting to see some positive signs as it relates to business travel, people are feeling better., Yeah, that's a great question. Before COVID, we had experienced a significant tightness in our labor market, and I'm going back about four years. The heavy maintenance business is a seasonal business in as much as you're very, very busy through the late winter and the spring and then at the beginning of summer, airlines typically pull their aircraft out of maintenance and fly them for the busy summer flying season. And it'd come back, they'd all come back into maintenance in the fall. And so, we historically would scale our workforce up and down to match that demand., About four years ago, when we went back into the labor market to hire a couple of thousand mechanics, we found that they weren't available. And that was a wake-up call for the company four years ago. And as a result of that, we believe – we were leaders in the industry in this regard, really focused on developing relationships with schools, changing our pay structure, changing the way we recruit and train people and really try to, particularly with relationships with the school, kind of a proprietary source of talent into our hangars. Those efforts, which again occurred well before COVID, are really paying off now. Those relationships that we kept going throughout COVID have really helped. So, while we are feeling pressure, everybody is feeling pressure, the efforts that we put in and the relationships that we developed from recruiting standpoint as well as the rationalization of our footprint around the best sources for labor during COVID have really put us in a good position., Having said all that, again, it is something that – it is a kind of constant – you got to be constantly vigilant. There are new market forces and pressures on the labor force every day. But we feel good about the position at this moment., The other thing I would mention is that we provide in the heavy maintenance business an extremely valuable service to our airline customers. There's really not a lot of places they can go candidly. And they know that we like they are under pressure in the labor market. And so, certain of our contracts allow for price adjustments to track changes in labor costs. And even the contracts that don't, we can have a very productive dialogue with the customer base because we provide a great service that they value and they are very aware of the labor pressures that we're all seeing., Yeah. John mentioned, we do see a pretty significant opportunity to invest in the business organically. And that's specifically coming through kind of parts and inventory to support the used material as well as the distribution, winning new lines of distribution., So I think, number one would be investing in the business to support growth. Number two is, we do see opportunity from an M&A standpoint. We have a strong balance sheet. The market is recovering and we think there will be opportunity going forward to put money to work via M&A to really accelerate the strategy, , And then, finally, on capital return, we were on the side lines in capital return because of the CARES Act funding that we received. So, we are working on kind of what the right capital allocation back to shareholders would be coming out of COVID as well., 
            , No, I'm just going to just say, I mean, obviously, this was a very difficult time for the industry. And if you look at the balance sheets of airlines, OEMs, et cetera, most everybody is coming out of this with a more stressed balance sheet, more debt, et cetera. We are one of the few, very few companies that actually are coming out with a significantly less net debt. And again, we think that puts us in a strong position to outmaneuver the competition when it comes to deploying capital., Thank you, Ken. Good to hear from you., Yeah. It was actually spread fairly evenly. We saw, as we mentioned, at the end of Q4 and at the beginning of Q1, a real uptick in activity in parts in general. And then, after Delta took hold, we saw that come down a little bit. But it was relatively stable throughout this quarter, which was up slightly from the prior quarter across both distribution and trading. And MRO was relatively stable, but – and so, most of the growth actually come from the parts businesses., Well, I think you've gone through a large – that's a great question. I think you've gone through in large part the destocking around the world. And parts demand for narrow body aircraft, particularly here in North America, has recovered. The areas that we're waiting to see recover are the international markets. And again, parts is our most international business. So, once we have clarity on consistent – borders being open and travel restrictions being lifted, that's when we would expect to see more continued – more consistent demand in the parts business., And unfortunately, the timing of that is obviously very difficult to predict. But related to that, because you've seen the destocking largely complete and you've seen a preference in the – towards USM material, we believe that once you get more consistent demand as markets fully reopen, there's going to be quite a run on used material because shelves are empty and airlines will have more confidence in consistent flying. So, it's difficult to predict when that's going to occur. But we do expect when it does, it'll be a pretty meaningful uptick., I wouldn't want to get into specifics on that. But we have seen from a market standpoint, I would say international markets such as Asia as well as just legacy carriers here in North America, a significant increase in interest in USM. And so, again, it's difficult to predict the path and pace of that growth. But we know that it is there., Thanks, Ken. You too., Yeah. Great question. The comments about sequential growth are based largely on – as I mentioned, we did have some sales slip from Q2 and now it will occur in Q3. And so, we're just looking at our backlog across the company, which gives us confidence that you're going to see sequential growth. There's no question, you said it, the response to Omicron definitely was more rapid and more broad than what you saw with Delta. But we tend to agree with what other airlines have said publicly is that the impact of these – of each new variant will be shorter as society and as industry and as governments are able to respond more quickly and then hopefully relax restrictions more quickly. Delta was the first example of that. Obviously, we're seeing something – we're seeing the next generation here with Omicron. But we're hopeful that each one of these cycles, if you will, each one of these waves, the duration will be shorter than the prior. But the comments specifically related to quarter-over-quarter growth are tied to what we see right now in current backlog., If you go back to the guidance we previously provided, we said that we would be between – this quarter that we would be somewhere between Q4 and Q1., Obviously, we're on the lower end of that. Had those products shipped as planned, we would have been right in the middle of that guidance., Some – it'll be some. Most of our wide body exposure in the parts business – and I should say that we have more wide body exposure in the trading business than we do in the distribution business., And most of the wide body exposure in the trading business is cargo related., There's some commercial, but that's , Great. Thank you, Mike., Yeah. Great question. I would view that as an FY 2023 contributor. The ramp-up time for the contract is actually relatively compressed as these things go. But there is the potential that the contract is , Yeah. Great question. As we mentioned, the capital allocation, the priorities are first organic investment, second inorganic investment, and third returning the capital to shareholders. And given where the net leverage is in the company right now and the opportunity set that we see, we believe that we're in a position to execute on all three. And so, there are a number of organic investment opportunities, whether it's in the trading business or the distribution business that we're looking at right now., M&A is something that does remain a focus of ours, and on the commercial side, it's been a tricky environment to pursue deals. But it is – it does remain a part of our growth – M&A does remain a part of our growth strategy. As it relates to the timing of this, I mean, we fully intend to fully authorize – or utilize this authorization. And as to pace, as Sean mentioned, we're going to commence this quarter, and then depending on market conditions, as well as how opportunities unfold in the next few quarters, that will determine the ultimate pace of employment – or deployment. But at this point, we chose that amount because it fits relative to the other opportunities that we see and it's something that we think we can get done in a reasonable period of time., Yeah. That is correct. That is correct., Great. Thanks, Ken., Yes., Yeah. Again, a great question. And the labor dynamic is something that we're paying an awful lot of attention to. And the short answer to your question is it's really tight, but because of the initiatives that we – but it's really tight and I would say it is definitely tighter than it was pre-COVID. And I would characterize that as we're seeing pressure not just at the lower – or not just with the mechanic hourly labor, but up and down throughout the organization. And so, it's a bit broader base in terms of tightness. But because of the initiatives that we announced pre-COVID and have pursued through COVID, we think we're in a pretty good position., The other thing I would say is that the customers have worked very closely with us to keep the hangers and the loading in the hangers relatively consistent. So, what we used to experience with major dips during the summer and significant dips during the holiday season, which resulted in up and down moves in the overall labor force, the customers have worked with us to level-load it through those periods, which has allowed us to keep the labor force together. And so, it's a long answer to your question., But sitting here today, we feel good about the schedule that we have and our ability to meet the schedules and – but it's a daily focus of ours., I think at this point we're thinking up and down, but I would highlight that again we remain in an uncertain environment. But when we say similar, we mean top and down., Yeah. I think..., Yeah. So, it was largely the demand. We had a great quarter in the commercial business across the board. The majority of it was really driven by the trading business which is still considerably far off pre-pandemic levels, but they did have a nice sequential improvement. What we are seeing is that while we had kind of increasing levels of activity throughout the quarter, we have seen more stability in the phase of that recovery moderate in the last few weeks. And we attribute that to the pullback in the bookings that you've seen from our commercial customers., Your comments on Canada are right on. We're really happy that Canada has opened up and that our customers there, notably, Air Canada, are seeing more activity. That was not a considerable contributor to this quarter, but we do expect it to contribute to results going forward., Yeah. Hey, it's Sean. It was a little mixed on the government's side. That was down a touch sequentially. As we talked on our Q4 call, there was a few events in Q4 that drove outsized profitability on some government activity. So, you saw a little bit of a decrease on that which is what drove the sequential decrease from 16.5% to 16.1% but still feel very good about the overall profitability. And as we talked about as parts continues to grow that will be accretive to the margin., Yeah. The relationship is going very well. That program is performing exactly how we expected. Fortress is a great partner and doing everything they said they were going to do. And that program, at this point, is a full contributor, I would say, at a basically a full run rate in the quarter. And we expect those levels to be consistent throughout the rest of the year., 
            , Hey, great, Ken. How are you doing?, We have seen more assets become available to us in the last few weeks. And there are some – and again, for competitive reasons, I don't want to get into too much detail, but we have seen more things come available that are interesting to us. I would not characterize that as – it would be too anecdotal and too soon to call it any sort of trend that would suggest the meaningful uptick in retirement/or teardown. But anecdotally, we have seen a few more come out recently. The activity that we saw this past quarter was largely due to material in stock., The pricing that we've seen has actually been consistent over the last two quarters. We've worked very hard over the last few years to get our customer base down to a more focused long-term contract big customer. So, we're operating on the long-term contracts in almost all of that business. So, the pricing has been relatively stable. What we have been able to do, and this was by design based on the changes that we made during the pandemic, is really improve our efficiency inside the hangars. And by optimizing our footprint and aligning our hangar space with where we see the most labor availability and that full-time labor availability as opposed to contract labor, we've been able to achieve superior performance inside the hangars., Yeah, good question. We feel good about the remaining portfolio. That was something that happened right after the end of the fourth quarter. And we characterized that when we announced the end of year results. And so, in terms of anything new happening in this quarter, there wasn't anything. But that program contract, that was situational. And I would say kind of a one-off. And we feel good about the remaining portfolio, and very excited that we , Thanks, Ken., Okay., Hey, Rob., Sure. MRO was relatively stable throughout the quarter and that continues to be the case as we go into the first quarter, which – and I think we commented on this in the last earnings call, that's a bit unusual. Usually, you see a decline of activity in MRO as aircraft return to the sky for summer flying. In this case, we are seeing a more steady performance there. The parts businesses did continue to improve slightly throughout Q4 and we have seen a bit of improvement most notably on the parts trading side just at the very beginning of the current quarter., No. No, the cargo business has been, again, relatively stable throughout the entire pandemic. I mean, we saw a bit of growth early on as we turned our attention to that market, but I'd say for the last several quarters now, it's been relatively stable. I think what you're seeing is obviously air travel is pacing ahead here in the US and so, you're seeing some of our larger customers burn through inventory that they've had on the shelf as opposed to buying from suppliers. We expect that to come to an end and expect to see more activity in the used parts and new parts business in the coming quarters as they burn through that inventory., But in the rest of the world and our parts business is our most international activity. You've got markets with one exception, China, I'll come back to that in a second. You've got markets that are just behind in terms of overall flying activity. And that's certainly impacting the pace of the recovery in the parts business as well. China on the other hand, as you know, their domestic flying has recovered largely and has been that way for several months and we actually had a record year in the China market., Yeah, sure. Exactly. So in the MRO business, we're being much more disciplined about the work that we take on post-pandemic than what we had before. We're really matching the volume of work that we choose to accept, if you will, with the availability of skilled labor. And pre-pandemic, we had a very heavy reliance on contract labor to produce more labor hours, but that was in a much less profitable level than what we're able to achieve today. So based on the current footprint and labor capacity, it's possible that we'll be a bit smaller in the heavy maintenance business but a much more profitable business than we were pre-pandemic., Having said that, we continue to look at our footprint in North America and look at ways to potentially better align that footprint with labor availability than based on where we see the most supply of labor than what we have today, so that's something we're continuing to monitor., On the parts side of the business, in the USM market, we see the potential for that to actually even exceed pre-COVID levels based on early indications that we've talked about this in prior quarters based on indications from the customer base that there would likely be an increased acceptance of used material in the aftermarket. So obviously, we need to make sure we have material to supply, but we see the potential for even greater growth out of that business over the next couple of years., And then on the new parts business, we remain very, very bullish on that business. We've announced a number of new distribution agreements over the last couple of years. There are more in the pipeline that we plan to announce. And that business as we add more parts, both on the government side, as well as the commercial side, we definitely see that business growing beyond pandemic levels., And finally, on commercial programs, that's a business that we've done a lot of work to restructure. It's in a much better place than it was pre-pandemic. It is smaller than it was pre-pandemic but we still intend to be a participant at that market, but just more disciplined about the contracts that we go after., Sure. Sure. In terms of capacity measured as – looking at our footprint, we still have a lot of capacity left, but again we're really measuring capacity on our ability to attract full-time skilled labor. We are using contract labor a bit, but we don't want to rely on that as heavily as we did pre-COVID. So based on the labor capacity, we're pretty close to full at this point. And having said that, as I mentioned, we're looking at potential opportunities to realign our footprint, but with where we see available labor, which would expand our capacity down the road., And then in terms of the shortage overall, there is definitely an elevated amount of maintenance activity out there right now. There's a lot of deferred maintenance that has not been done. There is – and I think that's globally and , Thanks, Rob., Hey., So we've done a lot as we've mentioned in terms of structural changes to improve the margin. Those are largely done. And Sean mentioned this most recent contract that was terminated that will contribute to that. So a lot of that has been done. The majority of the margin improvement that we expect to see in the medium term will come as the revenue recovers in our more profitable parts activities. So I would say the lion's share will come from that. Over the longer term – and I should say medium to longer term, we would expect to see additional margin improvement coming from certain of our digital initiatives. We are making investments in that area that will start to come through in the coming quarters in terms of , That's not something we typically discuss publicly, but we articulated several years ago our strategy is to be a Aviation Services company. And as we look at the portfolio, anything that doesn't necessarily align with that strategy long term, certainly, we continue to evaluate., Great. Thank you., Yeah. So we don't break out the margins on an adjusted basis, but you can kind of take a look at the adjustment and kind of allocate some of that. But it is relatively close to the margin that I gave in terms of GAAP., Yeah. Yeah, definitely, the US airlines – outside of China, the US airlines are certainly well ahead in terms of that inventory burn down. And as I mentioned just in recent weeks, we started to see some noticeable pickup in activity on the parts businesses, both new and USM and that's largely being driven by US carriers. We expect that you'd see the same kind of curve occur around the world as aircraft get back into service. I mentioned a couple of calls ago that we do a lot of business up in Canada. We've got two great facilities up there. And Canada has been largely shut down through this time. And we were very encouraged yesterday to see the announcement come out that they've got a timeline to open the borders. And , Yeah. That's actually going – that program is going really well. Fortress is a great partner. So far, they are right on the money with the number of engines that are coming through to us. So I would say the induction of engines is right on pace. The bookings that we are starting to see now that the engines are being processed and parts are being repaired and they're being marketed to customers, so the bookings are right on pace with our expectations. But you did not see very significant shipments yet in this quarter or in Q4. You'll see a bit more in Q1 and we'd expect later this fiscal year in terms of actual shipments in the quarter, we would be at full run rate., No. So that's just taken a look at the, call it, activities, , Yeah. We're not – obviously defense, you got a little bit better line of sight on, but in terms of not giving guidance, don't want to kind of go into specifics. As John mentioned, some of these contracts may be re-compete and ultimately stay or add. So there's some uncertainty there and going to quantify kind of the forward look for sales on that., Thank you., Hey, Ken., I mean, we – I think you have pent-up demand, there is no question out there. And so we would expect to see once that inventory is burned down, thanks to elevated utilization that our recovery would, I would say, kind of outpace utilization in the early part as you catch up, if you will, but then track with increased utilization once we hit steady state in terms of parts supply and consumption., I think what I would say is that the US is definitely going to be sooner than international because of the increase in utilization that you're seeing in the US. It's difficult to predict right now. I'd go back to what I said earlier and as much as just in the last few weeks, we've seen some higher highs, if you will, in the – that parts activity. So we're encouraged, we're encouraged. But at this point, I wouldn't want to attempt to predict precisely when we would see that elevation., So, off the top of my head, I can't take the specific examples yet, but anecdotally, absolutely there is a lot of discussion about that. We have had conversations with a couple of our customers and as much as to the extent that that occurs, would we be able to service it. And it kind of all depends in terms of how we balance that versus other demand. Historically, I think you know that we've been largely a narrow-body operation in North America, both in Canada, in the US and so, that's been our primary focus. But to the extent that an existing customer wants to repatriate work and we can make room for it and find the technical labor to support it, we'd certainly be open., Yeah, we continue to believe that that should be a part of our portfolio and we continue to look at internal initiatives as well as partnership opportunities with other PMA houses out there., Yeah. Good question and we are. We've definitely seen a moderation in the weekly order volume out of the DLA and we attribute that to – the new administration is going to focus on spending money on the next generation platforms as opposed to the prior administration's focus on sustainment and readiness. So we do expect moderated growth in that regard., Having said that, even though same-store sales on military product lines may actually come , Thank you, Ken. Really appreciate that., Hey, Josh. How are you?, It's a great question. There is one program – we have a couple different operations that are involved in Afghanistan. One program is actually being restructured. The operation will change, but the kind of financial impact to AAR will be neutral to positive based on that restructuring., The other significant operation we have over there is in support of the WASS contract. And at this point, it's unclear what, if any, impact the withdrawal will have to that operation. We do – but your point on the opportunity is exactly correct. I mean, there will be a number of ways that that country will be supported differently going forward and we are focused on participating in that to the extent that we can., So WASS, I would say, philosophically, a Democratic administration tends to rely more on diplomacy than a Republican administration. So WASS had its best years under Obama, for example, prior to Trump. And so, we believe that to the extent that the current administration looks to increase the level of diplomatic activity around the world that WASS could be a beneficiary of that. None of that has occurred yet, but certainly, it's something that's on our minds., Both., Yeah., Great. Thank you., Great., Yeah. I wouldn't want to quantify that at this point. We – that's not something that we historically broken out. But we tend to think of it in terms of labor hour production and for competitive reasons, wouldn't necessarily want to get into that. But we would expect fewer hours but a higher yield on those hours this fiscal year., And then, I would also point to – that's where we are today. But to the extent that we can stay true to the model of servicing the demand with full-time employees as opposed to relying on contractors and adjust our footprint, so that we can continue to attract more full-time employees and go where the skilled labor is, that would allow us to expand our capacity and potentially get back to the hour production that we saw pre-COVID, but again on a – with much better yield. So that's how we're thinking about it., Yeah. I think a lot of those – and that goes back to my earlier comments around the parts businesses in particular. We believe that USM, thanks to likely increased user adoption of aftermarket material as well as programs like Fortress. And then on the new parts distribution business, the lines that we've announced over the last year and a half as those grow back to pre-COVID levels, we see both of those businesses have the opportunity and the foundation to ultimately exceed the volumes that we saw pre-COVID just on deals that we've already done. That's not counting on new business that we have in the pipeline. At this point, again, I would say it's just difficult to sketch out the pace and size of that, but we have a broader foundation to build from than we did pre-COVID for those businesses in particular., Yeah. So the airframe has always been the focus of – or the primary focus of the MRO businesses. And don't forget, you've got landing gear component in there as well, but the airframe , ...the primary focus of the MRO business. The parts business, the primary focus in the aftermarket has historically been the engines, and we expect that to continue and we see the most opportunity for us there, supplying engine parts, not overhauling engines, but supplying engine parts in most cases to shops that perform the overhauls. And again, as Fortress is detailed, there is a tremendous amount of cost savings opportunity for customers as they look to overhaul engines by using aftermarket engine part material as opposed to buying new from the OEMs., Yeah., Absolutely. We see a lot of opportunity for organic investment in that market. You recall, a year ago, we announced the Unison deal. That was a meaningful investment. That's tracking right where we expected. There are other programs that we've announced since then and other things that are in the pipeline. Some of them require capital, some of them do not. But we are very excited about the position we occupy in the distribution space because unlike a couple of our larger competitors at this point, we've got a balance sheet that we can put to work and it's our core focus., Yeah. I think there'll be some modest investments, some of that will be in SG&A, as I mentioned, to see a bit of an increase there. And then in terms of the capital, CapEx, obviously last year was a lean year for CapEx. So you'll see some of that digital investment come through CapEx, which will be higher than this past year, a little bit more in line with historical years before that in terms of total CapEx., Thanks, Rob., Yeah. So I think we've made a lot of improvements in terms of the cost of the company which shows up in our cash flow efficiency and working capital management. As you think about what occurred in FY 2021 and try to – and compare it to FY 2022, obviously inventory was a significant provider of cash in the fiscal year as we focused on that and managed our position there. I don't think you'll see the same performance in FY 2021, because as John mentioned, there'll be opportunities both on new material as well as use material, which will show up in inventory largely to put capital to work. But we kind of haven't sketched out a specific conversion target. We'll continue to focus on managing working capital and driving free cash flow, but with a little bit more of an eye towards putting money to work on new investments., Thanks Ken., Hey, Rob. How are you?, 7%., 7% sequential., Yeah, sure. So we did see elevated – in MRO, we saw elevated maintenance activity go on from Q2 to Q3. And in the parts business, it was relatively stable. Typically, you do see maintenance activity pace ahead of parts requirements because repairing aircraft generates parts requirements so that's not surprising to us necessarily. But the growth primarily came from the MRO segment., In the parts side, though, as I mentioned, we are encouraged that we saw a broader customer base returning to the market on the parts side, both in new parts sales and USM parts sales. If we look at the prior couple of quarters, there was quite a bit of activity being driven out of the freighter and cargo market. And we saw some names candidly that we hadn't seen in a while from the passenger market come back in the quarter. All of that still added up to relatively stable performance but it was encouraging to see some of those customers come back., Yeah. So that would kind of vary by asset type. So if we look at the freighter market, the engines and airframe to support the freighter market, we've got very strong demand and the supply at this point, because of all the conversions going on, is actually relatively tight., If we look at the broader narrow-body market, the current generation Airbus A320, current generation Boeing 737NG, we are seeing increasing interest from customers that had previously not had an interest in USM as well as I mentioned customers that we haven't heard from a little while come back into the game. So we expect increases in USM demand there, but we do differently than what we see in the freighter and cargo market. We see more supply becoming available in the broader narrow-body market., Yeah. I think – so, yes. Overall, that activity, the kind of the line from grounding to retirement from part-out has taken a bit longer to occur than we might have thought a couple quarters ago. But we still believe you're going to see increased material availability over time., Our focus certainly is we want to pay attention to those macro trends, but our focus is on our own agreements that give us proprietary access to material to support the demand that we see ourselves. And the Fortress deal that we announced last quarter is example of that., We'd have to look at that., Yeah. We would anticipate that the vast majority of overhead takeout is sustainable through the recovery and kind of committed to that reduced overhead cost structure. We are seeing some efficiency improvement in our operations, but then there's also the reduced indirect and that shows up in the gross profit, and then the reduction in SG&A you can see in the quarter as well. So some of that will come back as volumes recover, but we do think that the vast majority will stick., Absolutely., Hi, Ken., As we mentioned, we expect a modest improvement sequentially from Q4 to – or from Q3 to Q4. And not ready to necessarily call a year-over-year improvement, but it's pretty close., Yeah. So, overall, we're encouraged by the levels of demand that we're seeing for hangar space right now. One thing that we mentioned before that we do have some international activity that is pacing behind what we're seeing in the US. And as you know, we have a couple of fairly meaningful operations up in Canada, and Canada has been closed like what you're seeing over in Europe. So those operations still have a ways to go to get back to pre-COVID levels. But in the US, we're definitely seeing a recovery pacing ahead., We are, as Sean indicated, very focused on our operating efficiency. And what we've driven over the last several quarters is a much more efficient and productive and higher-quality operation in our MRO facilities than what we saw before COVID. And so, we're being very thoughtful and very disciplined about how we bring back work across the network so that we preserve the gains that we've made in the past few quarters., One other point on MRO, you have a mix of work that is being done right now to prepare for what we expect will be a busy summer travel season, a busy leisure travel season, but you've also got some deferred maintenance that's starting to come through. And as we think about Q4, going into Q1, it's likely that you wouldn't see the typical seasonal decline in the hangars that you have historically because airlines, at least in the US, are going to use that time most likely to catch up on some deferred maintenance., So far, it's been relatively consistent throughout the entire pandemic., Great. Thanks, Ken., That's right. Commercial is a little bit below, defense a little bit above. You'll see some of that detail in the Q that will be filed here shortly., Sure. Historically, the business mix has been relatively 65% domestic and 35% international. As it relates to the domestic, we still have a ways to go to get back to where we were relative to pre-COVID levels and that's across both MRO and the parts business in particular., The international segment, as you mentioned, is pacing far behind due to the restrictions that are in place. China, China domestic is almost back to pre-COVID levels but the rest of Asia is very, very soft and Europe remains very, very soft relative to pre-COVID levels., Yeah. Appreciate you asking that. I don't want to get into specifically quantifying that deal but suffice to say, it would have been a meaningful contributor to us and that we expect it to be a meaningful contributor to the trading results, to the USM results. Fortress has been a great partner for many years or in that joint venture with them was really a nice next step in the relationship. And we are – we have received the first set of material from them so it will be a – I would say a small contributor this quarter and we expect growth going into next fiscal year., Sure. Absolutely. And again, we're very, very pleased with the progress that we made in a short amount of time. And as you know, we've been taking a number of actions across the company and in a number of different areas to drive this margin improvement that included exiting underperforming product lines, underperforming contract. We've consolidated a number of facilities, and then we've just taken ISG&A head count out. We've also deployed technology in certain areas. These were initiatives that were underway pre-COVID that are now kicking in and helping driving efficiencies. So we definitely see more runway as it relates to margin improvement as we see revenue recovery., In the MRO business, for example, you mentioned labor, yeah, it's definitely not coming through labor rate relief. We have really focused on, as we retool the labor force, making sure that we hung on to and took care of our most experienced mechanics. And we've got to focus now on limiting the amount of contract labor that we use in the operations so that we have the most experienced employee base who are able to turn a higher-quality product and do it more efficiently than what we saw before. And so, in the MRO business, which historically have been one of our lower-margin performers, we're seeing some nice gains there in terms of our income performance., And then you're absolutely right, as the parts business starts to return, that historically has been a higher-margin business for us. And once that starts to kick in at the revenue line, you'll see that flow through operating margin as well., Yeah. I wouldn't want to get into that just for competitive reasons. But I would just say that you really see a lot of variation between asset types at the moment., Here in the US, and that represents the majority of the subsidies we take. And we were eligible to receive additional CARES money under the original program as well as under the new program. Given the strong performance of the company and our cash generation, we elected not to participate in those two US options. Canada and our facility in the Netherlands, for example, there are programs still available there. And we continue to evaluate whether or not we'll avail ourselves to those going forward., Yeah. We're paying very close attention to what's available, what becoming available, what we would like to be available. And to the extent that we can find the right opportunity, we feel good about being in a strong position to execute., Thank you., Hey, Josh., Sure. In the parts business, the majority of the activity over the last couple of quarters has really been driven by the cargo market. We don't see that changing. We think that's going to be a strong market for some time. But in this quarter, for the first time in a while, we saw meaningful inquiries and in some cases actual orders out of our larger historical passengers. So we see them kind of reentering that the fray, if you will, in the parts business., In the MRO business, as we mentioned, the Canadian operations have been quieter than the US operations. But you are seeing the domestic – to support domestic leisure travel, that activity increasing here in the US in the MRO market., And then the government...., As you've seen from the numbers, the government business has remained very strong this entire time. We've put up three quarters in a row of year-on-year growth in the government business. And we remain very encouraged by the pipeline of opportunities that we see there., Yeah. The WASS contract, the INL/A contract is actually performing very well. We're really happy with the way that's gone over the last several years. And our customer, the Department of State, is also very happy with our performance. That has turned out to be a much more dynamic program than we might have thought when we took it on in as much as you do have locations that open and close with a fair amount of regularity., So if we go back to the early days of the program where we were publicly disclosing – opening and closing every time a base – every time we went into a new location, we realize that that was going to be a more frequent event than we thought, so we moved away from it. But there has been an up and down operational tempo between locations. But the overall revenue contribution and income contribution of that program has been very stable for the last several quarters., Unclear. Unclear right now, but no meaningful change expected one way or the other at this moment., Great. Thanks, Josh., Yeah, I think that's right. Obviously as the recovery occurs and in my comments on keeping this cost structure, you'll see improvement on that once we start to see the top line recover., Once we reach final agreement with the government, it will be done and gone but we still have a little bit of work to do to finalize the settlement., Thanks., It's definitely the latter. I wouldn't necessarily relate those two things to more work hitting the market as a result of outsourcing but the latter is true. We are very focused on maintaining and expanding the margin gains that we've seen over the last few quarters and that leads to just being a bit more selective about the work we take on and really focusing on increasing the throughput on a smaller footprint than we had pre-COVID. As you remember, we did close one of our sites. Unfortunately, it's a difficult decision to lose, but that has allowed us to achieve more efficiency across the remaining network., We still believe in the connection between the MRO business and the rest of our businesses and certainly feel even better about that as we look to continue to improve the margin performance of the MRO businesses. That's a very dynamic market, and so we're always going to be on our toes there in terms of how we win and how we perform and what goes on there from a competitive standpoint, but we're still fans of the connection between MRO and the parts and the programs business."
1004,2022.0,Q&A,a,"Hey, Ken., Sure. Both of those were actually consistent with what we saw in Q3, so in the parts business, as we indicated, we got off to a slower start. We saw volumes a bit down early in the quarter, which we assumed was related to pullback from the Omicron variant – as a result of the Omicron variant, and then throughout the quarter is the – as the impact of that variant subsided, we saw accelerating parts volumes that ultimately – and that's continued through today, ultimately, were higher than what we saw in Q2. But net-net, parts was about even quarter-over-quarter., The MRO business was consistent from Q2 to Q3. Again, the hangars there remained largely full, and we're really happy with the performance there. The growth, though, quarter-over-quarter, or sequentially came from other areas of the commercial business. We saw a recovery in our commercial programs business, so our customers in that area started to fly more hours, which translated to more revenue given the nature of the PBH programs. And then, we saw other strong performance in other areas of the MRO business out of component repair, as well as our landing gear operation., Yeah, sure. And I think you highlighted, you've got a few different competing dynamics there. Certainly, it's a situation we're monitoring and it's a situation that AAR has seen many time over the decades that we've been in the industry. I would say that this is a pretty meaningful – a function of how much of the fuel price increases the airlines are ultimately able to pass on to the consumer., We've talked to lots of our customers and there's varying views on how much of that will be able to be passed on. So that's a factor that ultimately drives how they think about their expenses. But as we think about the customers' operating costs and to the extent that they see sustained increases, it's going to drive them to lower cost solutions, and we are a lower cost solution., Yeah. Good question. And I think the capital allocation priorities remain the same. We do see increasing opportunity to invest organically and specifically in the parts business. So inventory has been providing cash over the past several quarters. And I think that we're seeing opportunity on new business wins and distribution, as well as procurement activity and used serviceable material to invest in that., I think there continues to be inorganic opportunity via acquisition. So that will be – we think that could be an area for us to allocate capital. And then, the repurchase; we did $20 million in the quarter. So got a good start to the new repurchase and we'll continue to look to put money to work there. But I think the balance sheet, as you say, is arguably under-levered, but we do think we have adequate and full opportunity to put money to work., Thank you, Ken., A great question, and the answer is really no. It's certainly top of mind for everybody. But the overriding conversation with our customer base right now – and again I'm focusing on North America and Europe – is really around being prepared for what our airline customers see as a very strong spring and summer., And the other thing we're getting is that there seems to be, I guess, a happy surprise around the pace of business travel return. And so, the airlines right now are just focused on making sure that they've got enough equipment available and ready to support what they see as a very strong couple quarters. So that's..., ..., Yeah. I think – again, good question. So the comment related to overall modest improvement from Q3 to Q4, that was meant to be overall sales, modest increase from..., ...from Q3 to Q4. And you've got a few different parts in there. You've got MRO, which we expect to have another strong quarter in MRO. And then, you have continued momentum in the parts business. But also, we haven't talked a lot about government yet, but in government, this will be another quarter of feeling the full impact of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, as well as the natural completion of some of the other government programs. And so, there's a lot of work that we need to do on the government side to make up for that, while we are, I won't say waiting, but focused on other longer-term government programs like the USAFE contract kicking in that will ultimately replace the loss revenue of Afghanistan., So, again, we're thinking about stronger performance out of commercial, but government is a bit of a mix at the moment while we're in transition between the wind-down from Afghanistan and the ramp-up of other long-term programs. And then thinking about next year, I think we mentioned that we're expecting modest improvement overall from Q3 to Q4, but a more meaningful inflection in the results as we get into our next fiscal year, and hopefully, cover this further and further in the rearview mirror., And as it relates to the first quarter specifically, the biggest seasonal driver there is typically our MRO business. And at this point, we expect – and again, all of this, subject to a dynamic environment. But at this point, we expect another strong summer as airlines continue to get aircraft ready to support recovery in demand., Yeah. I'd say – again, another good question. I'd say there's really three areas that Ukraine could – that that situation could provide positive tailwind for us. One is, we saw a pretty meaningful decline in our day-to-day parts business with the DOA as the new – as the Biden administration shifted priorities from spending on a sustained – shifted priorities from sustaining the current fleet to directing dollars towards next-generation development., Obviously, given where we are in the world right now, having the current fleet in a better position to be ready to go, it would seem that that would be a priority. And so, you could see more sustainment dollars being spent, which would translate into more parts demand for us. We haven't seen that yet, but it's something we could anticipate., The other area is in our Mobility business. You could see – to the extent that there's going to be troops moving around the world, you could see elevated demand for the shelters and containers that we manufacture. We have – again, we haven't seen that yet. But if we look over the decades, what typically follow situations like this, we would expect to see some activity there depending on how this unfolds., And the final thing and..., ...the third area that you've touched on is WASS, that is a program that's – a big part of it is flying diplomatic missions. Historically, you've seen Democratic administration such as the one we're in utilize diplomacy more. And so you may see increased tempo out of that program as a result of increased diplomatic activity, and that's another area where we could see positive benefit over time., Again, it's still very early. We haven't seen any meaningful movement in any of these areas, but those are the three key areas, I think, that could be impacted by a sustained – a prolonged conflict., Okay., Yeah., Yeah. I think – again, a good question – a couple thoughts there. Yes, to-date, we've had very constructive dialogue with our customers, where we need to, around potential adjustments to contracts to support increases in labor. It's definitely a tight market, as I mentioned. I think we're managing that very well. But it's still very dynamic and it's something we're paying a lot of attention to., And it varies by market. I mean, you might see tightness in one market and, therefore, we need to talk about raising wages in one area more than another, depending on how recruiting is going. And that, in turn, drives decisions or conversations with the customers. But so far, they've been supportive., If we think about that, as it relates to margin, yes, as labor costs increase and to the extent we cannot pass them fully on to the customer, we could see some margin headwind in the MRO business. But on the flip side, our parts businesses, which are higher margin than MRO, have not fully recovered. We're still down 20% to 25% there., And as we said, given the anticipated continued recovery in the overall industry, we expect those businesses, the parts businesses, the higher-margin businesses to get back to where they were pre-pandemic and, ultimately, exceed pre-pandemic levels, particularly in our new parts distribution business, because we've signed – and we just mentioned the Collins agreement – we've signed a number of new distribution agreements over the past two years, and those are not yet fully reflected in the results. And the pace of business in commercial parts distribution, ultimately, will lead to growth as we fully recover., So, again, you got some competing dynamics there between potential headwinds with labor costs, but then potential tailwinds with growth and recovery in the parts business, which is higher-margin., Thanks for asking that. We have had a coordinated effort with Collins and other large OEMs for some time now and the value proposition that we represent in the market as the largest independent distributor, and I say independent because we're not part of an OEM like Boeing or Airbus, that's gaining some traction. And as you've seen, we've had a steady drumbeat of meaningful wins over the last several years, and that's starting to get noticed., And the other thing I would say is that our sales force, our team really focuses on becoming technically proficient in our OEM partners' parts. And our goal is to go out there and help the OEMs that we partner with on an exclusive basis displace competitive products. So we're not a call center, we're not just holding inventory and waiting for a call, we're out there as a true extension of our partners. And we think that's a unique model in the industry. And again, it's getting some traction with the larger players like Collins., Thanks, Mike., Yeah. And again – so, yes, it's largely driven by our expectation around parts. We've been encouraged by the recovery in demand that we've seen of late. Provided that we don't get some other curveballs thrown at us as an industry by COVID, we think that trend is going to continue. And going back to what I've said earlier, given the fact that the parts businesses are still 20% to 25% down, there's room to run there, just out of recovery., And then given the fact that we've won new lines like Collins in distribution, as those lines mature and older lines recover, we've kind of got built-in growth there based on the business we've signed up. So, we feel good. I would expect that – so that's where the – we would look for the growth to come from., And then I would just go back to – on the MRO side, the hangars are full, we're performing well. And we're in a good spot there, but I was expecting a relatively stable performance out of MRO on the commercial side given where we are at capacity., Yeah. I think I think we need to see how that plays out. We feel good about the full impact. We feel really good about the progress that we've made to be in this position, ahead of pre-pandemic margins while sales have not recovered. We're very proud of the progress that we've made there., Going forward, I think we need to see how the competing dynamics in terms of the pace of the parts recovery, combined with how we address the potential labor cost headwind, we need to see how those dynamics play out. But I would say that we're very proud of the progress that we've made. And as that unfolds and as the mix plays out, we, over time, expect to continue to expand our margins. But it's difficult to get more specific than that right now., Great., Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Thanks for calling in. So generally speaking, if I think about the parts businesses in two areas, distribution, we expect to grow throughout the year. We've signed a number of agreements. Those contracts are maturing. You're seeing continued recovery on agreements that were in place before COVID, and we expect distribution to grow throughout the year., In terms of the aftermarket, the trading activities, I would say that that inflection point, we need a couple of things to occur. We are seeing continued utilization of green time from our customers. So certain engine overhauls are being delayed that we would have anticipated by now because aircraft are on the ground. There's aircraft on the ground due to pilot shortages and other reasons. So that's pushing that inflection point out, but we still expect it to occur in the second half of the year., And then, as it relates to margin, you've seen the full benefit of the structural changes that we've made, and that's put us around the 7% adjusted operating margin ballpark. As the parts businesses recover both in distribution and in trading, and that's the area where we still see the most opportunity for recovery and growth, those businesses are margin-accretive to where we are today. And so, as the mix shifts in that direction, ultimately, that should improve margins further., Yeah. Good question. I would say labor is definitely the priority for us. But definitely in the distribution business, supply chain challenges are something that we're focusing on. But the team has done a really good job managing that. So it's had somewhat of an impact on the results over the last few quarters in terms of delayed deliveries, et cetera and extended repair times. But overall, I think we've done a pretty good job managing through that., I'd say no meaningful update. The program continues to go well, and I know ADL was talking to a lot of interested customers., Thanks, Mike., Hey, Josh., I'd say it's largely the same. The vast majority of our activity is around narrow-body maintenance. What I will say, and we pointed to this earlier in the year, is that we've been able to change the relationship that we have with our customers to really drive a lot less seasonality in that business that we had seen before. We saw some. So there were some lines of maintenance that went away during the summer because the aircraft are flying. They'll come back in the fall. But it was much, much less significant than what we had seen in years past., And we're really pleased that our customers are working with us in this regard because we want to keep consistent aircraft and consistent workload throughout the year so that we can maintain the labor force, but also drive efficiency and the improved margins that you've seen., Yeah. Many of the wins that we've announced in the last couple of years have come from the larger players. So that would be Aviall owned by Boeing, Satair owned by Airbus, and then a handful of smaller, but predominantly the larger players., The Southwest relationship?, No, nothing new there. They remain a very large customer of ours and a great partner., Great. Thank you., Hey. How are you?, Yeah. Generally speaking, the green time is lasting longer than we would have anticipated. And the pilot shortage is definitely contributing to that, in as much as you've got a number of aircraft that are on the ground because airlines don't have pilots., I was with one of our larger customers earlier this week. And they shared with me that, at the moment, they've got 50 aircraft on the ground as a result of pilot shortage. Well, that's 100 engines that they now have access to, to swap around and burn off green time. But that's definitely persisting longer than we would have imagined., As it relates to overall supply, I would say nothing structural has changed. There's still plenty of demand and plenty of tightness out there in terms of used material supply. But we have – as we mentioned and you saw it in terms of putting out some cash this quarter, we have found some unique opportunities, and we were able to move very quickly and capture material, and that's good for us. But I wouldn't say that it's an indicator of anything larger going on in the market., Yeah. I think some of the – on the contract assets, we had some activity on our longer-term programs that weren't invoiced yet. I would expect those to get invoiced in the near term as I don't think you'd see that trend continue., On inventory and rotable assets generally, as we talked about, we see opportunities specifically on parts supply which would show up in inventory to procure USM material or to win new distribution business that would come with an upfront inventory buy. And then, rotable assets will just support our PBH programs that are recovering and continue to recover with miles flowing across the globe., Sequentially, it was twofold which was some lower activity on some of the shorter term programs that we won over the last couple of quarters, as well as reduced parts activity sales to the US government. We had a pretty strong Q4 and just a lighter Q1., Mostly ebbs and flows just a strong finish to our fiscal Q4., Hey, Rob. How are you?, Yeah. We would agree with that. And we think that's one of the core favorable trends that gives us confidence in the growth we're talking about inasmuch as the platforms that are bread and butter for us are going to be flying longer than people anticipated originally., Sure. USM market in general, we talked a couple of quarters ago about anticipating an inflection point in the recovery of that business and that was related both towards the demand as well as the supply. The demand out of customers has taken a bit longer than we anticipated at that time to come back. And there have been a number of factors driving that, but most recently what we have seen and heard from our customers is that they were still utilizing a lot of green time on engines. In other words, they had aircraft that were parked in many cases due to pilot shortages, and they were moving engines around to defer maintenance. For key customers that we support, that green time is dwindling and those engines and that deferred maintenance is now coming due. And so the engine shops, for example, that we support, we are seeing signs of increased demand as they look at their input schedule for 2023. So, we believe that an inflection point in terms of demand, we're at the beginning of that., Coupling that with surplus material availability, it has been a very tight market. We have just recently started to see things come available for certain asset types that we support and that was one of the reasons we put out the capital this quarter was to move quickly to acquire that material. And we are seeing, even if we look in the early next year, more opportunities to put capital to work to acquire material to support that anticipated increased demand for USM. That's the commercial market., The government market, we've had success here and there in terms of selling used materials to the government, in some cases on a small parts basis, but in other cases, in a whole aircraft basis, like we did a couple of years ago with the C-40s. But we haven't ever had a structural change in the law which is what's reflected in this NDAA language that compelled services like the Air Force and the Navy to consider USM., So, for commercial derivative aircraft like the C-40s or the P-8, which are 737s or the C-32 which is a 757, we think this could be the starting point of meaningful opportunity for AAR. How much and how long, I think, is a question. But, we're really encouraged by the fact that that language is now part of the NDAA., Yes. I think – 21% really across all commercial activities. I think we saw outsized performance in our distribution business, which reflects some of the new business wins over the last several years. And then also within our commercial PBH, which is the flight hour driven a little bit more international than some of our other commercial activities. We saw improved flight hour activity which drove that top line, but strength across all commercial that highlight those two is driving some of the outperformance., Yeah. I think if you look at our cash performance over the last eight or nine quarters, we're really proud of the cash that we've generated and obviously that's reflected by the low leverage ratio on the balance sheet. The inventory positions we had have been a source of cash, but as we look forward, we would expect to be more in investing mode in the back of this – back half of this year the way we were in the second quarter., Thanks, Rob., Hey, Ken., Yeah. As so the first part is the capital breakdown, it was slightly more towards the USM side. If we think about the two areas, USM and new parts distribution agreement was skewed slightly more towards USM but fairly equal between the two. And then on the new parts distribution agreements, I mean those are initial provisioning inventory buys that go along with these contracts when we take them on, and obviously we work down those positions over time as the contracts mature., As it relates to pricing in USM, I wouldn't want to get into that in particular for competitive reasons, but it remains a tight market. And we're able to achieve the right spreads between the prices that we pay for material and the prices at which we sell material. So, we're kind of market-in, market-out as it relates to these USM buys., Yes. We see a lot of opportunity in distribution. We see opportunity to expand agreements with our partners like Unison and we're real proud of that expansion. It's a big win for us and that's a 10-year-old relationship, and we're still finding more things to do with them. And we have a number of other long-term OEM relationships that are in the same category, whether it's opportunities to expand as they rethink their approach to aftermarket coming out of COVID., And then there's new areas. We've got an agreement with Leach that we announced that we expanded. That's a new market for us. That's electronic distribution. So we're selling piece parts in the production line. So that's a new market for us. And Leach has the launch deal there, which we've extended and we see more opportunity in that market. There's also opportunities in the BA/GA market., Obviously a lot of interest in BA coming out of COVID that's been a very strong market in general, and we think that our way to participate in that market is through distribution. And so that again would be a new focus for us, but a number of OEMs that we're talking to have interest in leveraging our distribution network., Yeah. I think margins in general – we had very strong quarter this quarter. I think margins in general in Q3 , Beyond that, to your point, as the mix continues to shift towards parts, as we recover and grow in that business and we start to get some efficiencies in MRO as a result of some of these digital initiatives in particular that we've been investing in, we would expect continued expansion beyond that kind of 7% level as those things take hold over the medium and long term., Yeah., Yeah. Great question. We see – so first of all, getting to that 10% or below SG&A as a percent of sales is still a goal. We believe that – the more significant contributor towards reaching that goal would be the recovery in the top line. We took a lot of cost out during COVID, as you know, made a lot of structural changes to the business. And our focus right now is just staying disciplined in terms of preserving those changes as we grow. So as top line continues to recover, we expect that percentage to come down., The other thing I would point out is we are making investments, particularly in the digital area that we do expense, and so that flow through those lines. Those investments are very much – we're in the thick of those right now. But they're projects. They've got a beginning and a middle and an end. And as we wrap up those projects, we would expect those expenses to come down and the efficiency as a result of those projects to start to kick in., Great. Thanks, Ken., Thanks, Michael., It's predominantly that, it's predominantly that. I mean, we have – in certain areas we've seen people cost go up as well. And so that's contributing to it, and that's some of the relief but ultimately we hope to get through some price adjustments to offset that. But it's those investments in those projects and then certain labor costs that are flowing through that line., Yeah. Great question. The goal of the price increases and this is very prominent in our conversations with the customers is to really preserve the current position. So, as we see labor costs go up, we're looking to offset those costs with price increases for the customers. And again, we've had very active dialog and it's been a very dynamic situation with the customers over the last couple of years in that regard, and they continue to be very supportive., So, that's the goals of the price increases is really just to preserve where we are and offset the cost increases that we have seen and that we do continue to see as we bring new people on. The margin expansion that we would anticipate over the medium term and MRO isn't going to come from the price increases. It's going to come from the efficiency initiatives, digital, et cetera, that we've got going on right now as those things kick in., I think that's definitely a dynamic to pay attention to. However, from where we sit, the more powerful dynamic is the extension of the current fleet as a result of those production delays., Yeah. I think – we saw some modest sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, and as John mentioned , Great. Thanks, Mike., Hey, Josh., It's really driven by the key customers that we support and their shop input schedule as they look over the next 6 to 12 months. So, you haven't seen the engine overhauls come through in a way that we expect to see them now based on what we're talking or based on what we're hearing from our customers. So, shop inputs would be the key metric., I think it's a challenge for everybody. So I think it's really a level playing field. So, I don't know that that necessarily changes the calculus of the airlines in terms of whether to bring in work or outsource work. I think that's a relatively stable relationship. So, our discussions are all positive in terms of the amount of work that they would like to continue to outsource to companies like ours., Well, I think – first of all, we anticipate – now that we can all be together again, we do anticipate getting back on a regular cadence with Investor Day next year. So, we're looking forward to that opportunity. But as it relates to the overall strategy, certainly, we want to wait till we have an opportunity to discuss that more fully. But, as you can tell, I mean we remain very focused on building out our parts capability. We're having a lot of success there, both on the USM and on the new parts distribution side., Our MRO portfolio is operating at a level of efficiency that we hadn't experienced prior to COVID. So we want to make sure that we preserve that. And in areas where we can expand MRO, where we have long-term customer interest and long-term access to labor, we expect to do that and look for ways to grow in that business., You mentioned digital. Digital, there's elements that benefit us internally from efficiency, but also digital offerings like Airinmar and Airvolution that drive new sources of revenue for us. And then we continue to look at ways to bring areas of IP, whether it's to PMA parts or DER repairs into the portfolio to drive continued margin improvement., And finally, we remain in a very strong position with the US government. We've really built a meaningful portfolio and past performance that allows us to bid on a variety of contracts. We've got a very strong pipeline of bids that are at work, as well as bids that are with the government right now. And so we feel very good and are positioned to continue to be successful as a prime contractor there., Great. Thanks, Josh., No, a great question. And no, I certainly would not want to suggest that M&A is off the table. Our framework for capital allocation is organic investment first, inorganic investment M&A is second and then returning capital to shareholders. And the balance sheet remains very strong. We're still less than 1 times levered. So we believe we've got the opportunity to deploy capital in the first area, organic investment but then also keep options open for M&A. And there are a number of companies out there that could be very interesting to us. Some are new; some we've been following for years. And to the extent that we find an opportunity where valuation and our strategy align, we absolutely would pursue M&A., Yeah. I think it's very much in the mix and it's a big world out there and we do see opportunities on a selective basis where we would not in any way be in conflict with our OEM partners to pursue PMA. We have an internal effort underway. It's very small. I was actually visiting the team a couple weeks ago, and there's some really exciting things that they're working on. But it's – relative to the total of AAR, it's a small operation, but we do expect to scale it over time. It's just – it's going to take a while. But the initiatives are around, coming up with PMAs that are only available to us for use in our own repairs as well as PMAs that we could offer to third parties., Thanks, Ken., I appreciate that. And all kidding aside, I mean, it's easy to talk about COVID being over because case numbers are going in the right way and , So there were contracts that were underperforming that we ultimately exited or restructured. We had businesses like our composites manufacturing business that had had been underperforming for years, and we took the opportunity to exit that business. We had facilities that were underutilized that we either exited or consolidated with other facilities. We had overhead in all forms that we took a hard look at and when you're going through a crisis where you have multiple product lines in the company that are down on a sustained basis, 80%, 90%, it forces you to look at every single thing you do., And us like many other companies, really took a dispassionate view is difficult decisions, but took a dispassionate view at the activities we were involved in and we have emerged a much cleaner and more focused aviation services company. At the same time, we were able to generate a great deal of cash during this and we really hit the overdrive button on cash generation. And that has served us well because , Yeah. That's a great question. Yes. Yes, in a way. And I'll tell you, probably the biggest thing that – it's still a focus of ours, but the biggest thing that unknowingly prepared us for us was our focus on labor, in our hangars, in our maintenance business, we are selling labor hours. We have thousands of mechanics that work for us and have been working for us throughout the pandemic, coming to work every day. And we're very proud of them. And if I go back three or four years ago, well before COVID, we started to feel the effects of a shortage of mechanics in this country and to deal – that had a pretty significant impact on our results at the time., And in order to deal with that, we developed a number of different partnerships with schools. We developed some of our own schools. We developed different ways to train people. We looked at our pay and we really changed the way we recruit, train and the way we kind of expect to retain people once they come into the company. And all of those things, again unknowingly were preparing us for the environment that we're in now. We're managing – and our most important supply chain is our labor supply chain. Managing that supply chain in a very effective way, don't get me wrong. It's still very tight right now and we're feeling it. But we – if I think about us versus some of the competitors that we see, particularly in the heavy maintenance market, I think we're dealing with it about as best as you can..., ...due to that, that work that we did up front., I think domestically and in certain international markets, and I'll talk more specifically in a second, there is a great deal of optimism right now. I think that there is a very high expectation that we are going to have a very strong summer, even stronger than last summer, in some cases maybe even stronger than 2019. And I think that we are starting to feel that optimism in our businesses. I was with actually a President of a very large airline last night and they're exceptionally bullish on domestic travel. They're much more bullish than they were last year at this time around European travel, both international as well as European domestic travel., I think there's still a big question about the timeline for recovery in Asia. For AAR, our two most important markets are North America as well as Europe. So the fact that there's a lot of optimism from our customers around the recovery and the strength of travel we'll see this summer, and of course, all of this is under the heading of, it's still – I mean we're – everybody is kind of counting on we're not going to see another crazy variant and nothing terrible is going to happen in that regard, but the optimism around our core markets in North America and Europe gives us a great reason to be confident about the coming quarters ahead., Yeah. I appreciate that. And as you mentioned, the balance sheet really low net leverage 0.4 times and plenty of flexibility to allocate capital across our priorities. And the way that we see them is first organic investment, putting money to work in the business to help drive the growth. And specifically, that's going to come in inventory, supporting the parts business, both used serviceable material, procuring new supply to match it to the demand, and then on the distribution side, as we win new business lines, having the upfront inventory purchase that comes with that. John talked about some of the digital initiatives, as well as some select expansion in MRO. So, I think organically that's where we put capital to work., Second, allocation would be for inorganic opportunity. We do believe that M&A can and should play a role in accelerating our strategy, and we're in a strong position of strength to be able to do that if opportunities do come up, that makes sense for us. And lastly, capital return, we were on the sidelines on capital return. We just reinitiated our share repurchase authorization back in December, $150 million, expected to be utilized over two years. And so, that's kind of how we rank our capital allocation priorities., 
            , Yeah. I think we do see the gap narrowing, and as John talked about, the increasing confidence around the outlook will serve to narrow the valuation gap that has existed as everyone's kind of come through the downturn, we've been in the recovery, but there's still a lot of uncertainty of the pace of the recovery. I think as we come through kind of this calendar year and have better clarity of what demand looks like, that should lead to more opportunity for parties to come together around transactions., MRO has been very strong for the last few quarters. It was actually one of the first – on the commercial side, one of the first businesses to recover, now recovered at a lower level because it was part of the changes that we made. We took out capacity intentionally and so now we've been operating at near capacity for the last couple of quarters, but it's a much more profitable business because we've streamlined the operation. The area of the business that has been lagging has been the parts business, which is our most profitable business, and if you look at the last quarter, we were still across both new parts and used parts. We're still kind of 20% to 25% below where we were pre-COVID., If you look at the customer sentiment now and I think going back to my comments around the confidence in the strength of travel in the summer in our two most important markets, North America and Europe, we would expect to see that starts to recover to pre-COVID levels. And again, all of that work that we did through COVID was designed to improve the operating margins of the company and we've seen six straight quarters of operating margin improvement. We expect that to continue and that will continue to be driven as our highest margin activity, the parts business recovers, and again, as long as we hold on the trend that we're on right now and that optimism remains in the customer base, we expect to see that business come back., Yeah., The majority of – vast majority of our business is narrow body and so domestic travel, whether it's business or leisure, is a good thing and it's certainly a good thing as it recovers over in Europe as well. So, in terms of the overall cycle of the fleet, certainly, COVID has disrupted that cycle and elongated the life of current assets, which is a good thing for us because we want all those existing platforms, but as the MAX comes in, we expect to be a MAX participant as well. And AAR, as we mentioned at the beginning, we've been around since 1955, we've seen generational turnover in aircraft over and over again, markets mature at a certain point, material becomes available, repairs are developed and an aftermarket develops and that's how we participate., One comment is going back to your question about the overall recovery in the parts business, I would add that in the USM business, we expect to recover beyond the levels we saw pre-COVID because we do believe that there has been and will continue to be increased user adoption of used material. It's hard to – it's harder for an airline to buy a used part than it is to buy a new part. Buy a new part, comes in a box, take it out, put it on. You know exactly where it's been. It's never been used before, et cetera. To be set up to receive parts, to inspect parts that have been flown before, have been repaired before, that requires a different set of procedures inside an airline. And once those things are set up and you're able to buy used parts and a lot of airlines are looking at that lower cost alternative because of COVID that expands the potential market., Additionally, if you look at our new parts business, we've announced a number of pretty significant distribution wins over the last 18 months, both on the commercial side as well as the government side. And as those contracts mature, that will take us beyond where we were pre-COVID on the new parts distribution business because we've expanded the base of OEMs that we support. So we feel that we're set up well to not just recover in our highest margin businesses, but ultimately grow beyond where we were pre-COVID., That's right. That's right., I think, it's a great – yes. It's tough to – honestly, it's tough to parse how much of it is , Yeah., Sure. We've talked a little bit about this. And we have some near-term, it's a very near-term headwinds on the government side of the business. Part of that was driven by the withdrawal from Afghanistan. We were actually a very significant contractor when we were in Afghanistan. And so that was a loss of revenue that we could not have predicted. So that's – we'll be feeling the full effects of that in the quarter that's ending now as well as the next quarter., We are doing everything we can to make up and then grow beyond that loss. We announced a win, the USAFE F-16 contract that we were awarded. It's going through some protest process at the moment, but we expect to secure that contract and that'll cover about half of the lost volume out of Afghanistan. There is a very strong pipeline of similar programs, PBL, CLS programs, and I mentioned making that migration from a sub-contractor to a prime contractor and the ability for us to bid on a much wider range of contracts, the pipeline for the company has never been stronger. These things take a long time to win, but once you're on them, these are long-term contracts., So overall, we feel about the government programs business. We're dealing with some near-term headwinds, largely as a result of Afghanistan and some other programs that came to natural completion. But overall, we feel that we're well-positioned there. Two other things I would mention, then there's the parts business with the government. We sell a lot of new distribution material to the DLA, it's about half of our distribution business. And we've built a really strong franchise for ourselves in the new parts distribution business to the government. We have also seen some near-term moderation in the demand of the government, and the macro theme is this administration has been prioritizing spend towards newer technologies as opposed to sustain it. Now, the current situation that hopefully we don't find ourselves in, but if we do, that may change the parts spend to support the fleet that's already installed. But we'll have to see how things unfold there., Last comment I would make about the government side of the business is very similar to an airline, if there is now a lot of cost pressure to maintain readiness on the thousands and thousands of aircraft across multiple platforms that are deployed already. That's going to cause you to look at alternative lower cost solutions, which again is what we what we provide. And a very simple example of that is applying the used model, the used parts model that's been very popular and increasingly popular on the commercial side, applying that to the government side. And if you look closely at some articles that have come out and some of the recent testimony in terms of confirmation hearings, there is an increasing drumbeat in Congress right now over looking at these types of and asking the services to more broadly consider aftermarket solutions such as what we offer. So we think again, it's going to go very, very slowly. But as organizations all over the world look for lower cost alternatives, for whatever reason, we're in a good spot., That's right., Yeah. Yeah., Maybe overall, but not for us. I mean, it's an important part of our business and became a more important part of our business during COVID. The majority of our wide-body exposure is to the cargo market, but for the customers that we service and the contracts that we're on, we feel pretty good about their – we feel pretty good about their demand., Yeah., Yeah., 
            , Yeah. So, I would say you're kind of a near to medium term beneficiary on the engine side for a couple of reasons. One, because of the overall interest in USM increasing, and airlines, there's a lot of deferred maintenance out there on their engines. And as they ramp up for a bigger summer flying season and growth beyond what they saw pre-COVID, we expect very strong demand for engine material. Then, the overlay supply chain issues with production on top of that right now. And so, you've got – even though the installed base is increasing, the ability to service the installed base is still somewhat challenged. So, that's another pressure that would leave customers towards used material. So, we see that as a near term to medium term benefit to us., But, over time, I would put those engines in similar categories to everything else. Those platforms are more mature, material will become available. The checks may be farther apart, but they're going to require more expensive material at the time of the check. And so, we ultimately see ourselves participating in that market the same way we have for the last several decades. Having said that though, the installed base of engines that we support today, I mean, it's tens of thousands of engines. So, I mean, it'll be a long time before you see any meaningful shift there., Yes., Yeah. You have to repeat it. Yeah., So, a few different things. One is the permanent cost that we took out of the company as a result of the changes that we made during COVID and there was about roughly $50 million of overhead costs that we characterized as permanent cost takeout. Other areas, there were underperforming contracts that candidly in businesses that were masking the strong performance of some of our underlying businesses, most notable the parts business. So, we've kind of gotten rid of that, gotten rid of that headwind., In our heavy maintenance business, for example, we had talked a lot about and really size that business around with the millions of labor hours that we would produce each year. So, we would talk about it being a 5 million or 5.5 million labor hour business. We took out about a million hours of capacity during COVID. And the reason that we did that is because that kind of 20% to 25% was largely being driven by contract labor and our ability to make money on contract labor is – it was basically a breakeven proposition for us. So we exited a facility, exited certain customers, shrunk our footprint and size inside of some of our other facilities to structurally bring that business down to where we're only working on aircraft with our own labor, where we can actually make money. And so, that's improve the margin profile of that business., So all of those things I just described are really reflected in the numbers through the last quarter. The further margin improvement we expect to get will be the continued recovery of the higher margin business that will shift the mix towards those higher margin activities. And again, we expect a recovery to pre-COVID levels in those businesses, and then beyond given the win that we've had over the last 18 months., Appreciate the question., Good morning, Ken., Yeah. You've got it right on the MRO side. From what we see today, the hangars are largely full and we expect continued strong demand throughout the year in heavy maintenance. On the parts side, the distribution business, the commercial distribution business continues to grow, and that's largely driven by the new wins that we've announced in the last 18 months as they come online. So we expect growth in the new business, in the new parts business as a result of those wins. In the used parts business, it's more of an inconsistent story. We saw quite a bit of accelerated demand through Q3 as well as through most of Q4. That demand has moderated a bit as we're in the first quarter of this year., The other factor you've got going on there is we see very strong demand in certain platforms, but as a result, there's also a lot of demand for material and that's in tight supply. And so with certain platforms where we see strong and consistent demand, it's a little bit more challenging to find the used material to service that demand., So, in summary, we're feeling very good about MRO, feeling good about the continued recovery and growth in commercial parts distribution, but a bit of an uneven story and trading based on the factors I just described., Yeah. Great question. So, in terms of feedstock and the trading business, that's one of our greatest strengths right now is our balance sheet capacity and our ability to move very quickly and outmaneuver the competition when packages or material become available. And we are in the market all day, every day, around the world looking for the right material. And when we find it, we're able to close very, very quickly. So that will definitely be a source of capital deployment for us throughout the year., As it relates to PMA and other initiatives specifically, we do have organic PMA efforts underway, and we're encouraged by the progress there. It's early and it's slow growing, but we do have a nice team focused on organic PMA efforts. And as we've indicated in the past, we will continue to look at inorganic opportunities to bolster that effort if assets become available and we can get valuation, et cetera, to align with expectations., Yeah., Yeah. We're really proud of the consistent cash flow that we've been able to generate and that goes along with the consistent margin improvement, et cetera, that we've been able to drive in the business overall. We certainly expect to be cash flow positive again this year. And our goal is to remain consistent in terms of cash flow generation., Having said that, though, just going back to your prior question, if we see an opportunity to make a great purchase of hot engine material or a feedstock to serve other parts of the trading business, we're going to deploy that cash and deploy it quickly. And again, that's an advantage of the market. So, while the goal, overall, is to continue to generate cash and continue to be more efficient with our working capital, we want to remain flexible so that we can react to market opportunities., Thank you, Ken., Hey. Good morning, Josh., Yeah. I'd say the unevenness is a bit from the – is more from the narrow-body. Our wide-body business in trading is largely to support the cargo market, and that's been consistent throughout the pandemic and very, very strong. And those are the areas where we find the tighter – the tightness in the supply of material., Yeah, that's a great question. That partnership continues to go extremely well. That has been a great source of material for us to serve that narrow-body market, and Fortress is doing a really fine job on delivering the commitments of material to us that they made at the beginning of the agreement. I mean, at this point, it's fully ramped up and we continue to work with Fortress as they expand their business and their engine portfolio. We could see growth in that platform. But at this point, it's operating at full capacity and at the level we expected., In the MRO business?, Yeah. So we – again, thanks for highlighting that. I mean, we're really proud of the way we held together the team through COVID, and that has served us very, very well. And it wasn't just holding the existing team; it was maintaining the partnerships that we formed with schools over time. We continue to fund those partnerships and we continue to get – see results in terms of, I would say, a proprietary source of talent with these relationships we have with the schools to support the MRO business., In certain markets, our capacity is limited by our ability to hire. And in other markets, our capacity is limited by , So at this point, when we say the hangars are full, we mean full both in terms of our footprint as well as labor availability. But as we move forward, we're going to, again, focused on some targeted expansion to look for ways to grow that business domestically., All right. Thank you., Yeah. Our goal right now is to preserve the margin gains that we have made. We've seen a lot of improvement and efficiency in that business over the last 18 months, and we want to hold on to that. So as we see increasing labor costs, that is driving any discussions we're having with the customer about price adjustments. But the goal there is to preserve the spot that we're in. That has been a very dynamic environment over the last three or four quarters. I think we've mentioned that our customers, as you heard from them, they're seeing the exact same labor pressures we are. And so they recognize the value that we bring and the service that we provide to them and the need for us to be profitable and to be able to attract talent. So it's a challenging environment for everybody. But so far, we've been very pleased with the support we've gotten from the customer and the need to change prices to address rising labor costs., Sure. So, again, very proud of the progress that we've made over the last seven quarters on operating margin improvement. And, as you know, we're now well exceeding, particularly with this configuration of businesses well exceeding the margins that we had pre-COVID. As we see the parts business recover and you're right, we're not at that inflection point yet where we'll see a meaningful step up from where we are. As we see that parts business recover and the overall revenue mix shift towards the parts businesses, we would see further margin expansion., At this point, it's difficult to predict the trajectory of that. As you highlighted, I don't think we'll see that meaningful step change in the first half of the year. But as the supply chain issues or labor issues get worked out in the system and airlines can service the demand that they see in flying increases, we would expect parts business to pick up in the second half of the year., Just to quantify that, our – both in the trading and commercial parts distribution, overall down still about 20% from where we were pre-COVID. That compares to roughly 25% from where we were in Q3. So we have seen a modest improvement there which contributed partially to the sequential margin improvement that we saw this quarter. But, given we're still 20% off of pre-COVID levels, we've got a ways to go in that business. And again, that would help margins throughout next year or this year., Hi, Mike., Yeah., Yeah, I think great question. I go back to prior comments in as much as we still see the potential for that. I think at this point, it's a second half discussion as opposed to a first half discussion. And when we talk about getting back to the pre-COVID peak revenues, keep in mind, we structurally took out revenue from the company from activities that weren't profitable or were unprofitable. And so really, in terms of getting back to pre-COVID levels, we're talking about the parts businesses. And that's that kind of 20% off that I just described., I think, overall, the airlines remain bullish on the return of demand. And we believe that the current generation fleet, based on what we're hearing, which is the fleet that we're predominantly involved in servicing, is still going to be around for longer than people initially expected. So that that bodes well for us. I think the challenge for the customers – for our customers right now is really, as you've heard from them, it's driven by the staffing challenges at the airports themselves, pilot shortages which have caused them to have to cancel flights and fly less. That's really their focus. But overall demand for air travel that we're hearing from our customers still remains very, very strong. It's just about getting the system back up fully running so that we can adequately support that demand. And so again, while we're kind of in a bit of an uneven period here, we still feel really good about that return of the parts business and the fact that the platforms in which we operate and perform maintenance on that they're going to be around for a long time., Yeah., Yeah. I think you've hit it on the head. I would definitely say that this is analogous to winglets. We're excited that they announced the SEC on the 737-700, and we know they're working on the same for the 737-800, 737-900, which obviously is a very large fleet. And given the price of fuel today, we expect that the airline community interest will be extremely strong in this solution. We were really happy to get – to start this partnership very early with ADL. We've actually been working with them for some time, and we have increased our investment in the company over that period of time. So we're very bullish both from an investment standpoint, but also as it relates to the exclusive agreement that we've got in place to distribute the kit as they're developed and produced., Thank you, Mike."
